  abstract = {Lake-level history for Birch Lake, Alaska, was reconstructed using seismic profiles and multiproxy sedimentary analyses including sedimentology, geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility, and palynology. Twenty-two seismic profiles (18 km total) and eight sediment cores taken from the lake margin to its depocenter at 13.5 m provide evidence for low lake stands during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Thirty-one AMS radiocarbon dates of macrofossils and pollen provide a century-scale chronology. Prior to 12,700 14C yr B.P., the lake, which now overflows, was either seasonally dry or desiccated for prolonged periods, indicating a severe period of aridity. Lake level rose more than 18 m between 12,700 and 12,200 14C yr B.P. before falling to 17 m below the level of overflow. Between 11,600 and 10,600 14C yr B.P. the water remained between 14 and 17 m below the overflow level. Onlap sedimentary sequences were formed during a transgression phase between 10,600 and 10,000 14C yr B.P. Between 10,000 and about 8800 14C yr B.P. the lake was between 6 and 9 m below the overflow level. Lake level again rose, approaching the overflow level, between 8800 and 8000 14C yr B.P. Seismic and core evidence of minor erosional events suggest lowstands of 2–6 m until 4800 14C yr B.P. There have been no prolonged periods of lake-level depression since that time. The major restructuring of the climate system during deglaciation evidently generated a complex set of fluctuations in effective moisture in interior Alaska, which likely affected eolian processes and vegetation development, as well as lake levels.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Sedimentary charcoal particles from lakes are commonly used to investigate fire history. Fire-history reconstructions are based on measuring the surface area or counting the number of charcoal fragments in adjacent samples. Recently, the volume of charcoal particles was advised as a more accurate method for quantifying past charcoal production. Large charcoal datasets, used to synthesize global fire history, include these different types of charcoal measurements and implicitly assume that they provide comparable fire-history information. However, no study has demonstrated that this assumption is valid. Here we compare fire-frequency reconstructions based on measurements of charcoal area and number, and estimates of charcoal volume from two lake sediment records from the eastern Canadian boreal forest. Results indicate that the three proxies provide comparable fire-history interpretations when using a locally defined threshold to identify fire events.},

  abstract = {Charcoal is the result of natural and anthropogenic burning events, when biomass is exposed to elevated temperatures under conditions of restricted oxygen. This process produces a range of materials, collectively known as pyrogenic carbon, the most inert fraction of which is known as black carbon (BC). BC degrades extremely slowly and is resistant to diagenetic alteration involving the addition of exogenous carbon, making it a useful target substance for radiocarbon dating particularly of more ancient samples, where contamination issues are critical. We present results of tests using a new method for the quantification and isolation of BC, known as hydropyrolysis (hypy). Results show controlled reductive removal of non-BC organic components in charcoal samples, including lignocellulosic and humic material. The process is reproducible and rapid, making hypy a promising new approach not only for isolation of purified BC for 14C measurement but also in quantification of different labile and resistant sample C fractions.},

Forty years ago, the advent of calibration signaled the death knell of the diffusionism that had been the mainstay of archaeological thought for a century. Since then, the revolution has continued, as the extent of calibration has been extended ever further back and as the range of material that can be dated has been expanded. Now a new revolution beckons, one that could allow archaeology to engage in historical debate and usher in an entirely new kind of (pre)history. This paper focuses on more than a decade of experience in utilizing Bayesian approaches routinely for the interpretation of 14C dates in English archaeology, discussing both the practicalities of implementing these methods and their potential for changing archaeological thinking.},

Fire influences global ecosystem patterns and processes, including vegetation distribution and structure, the carbon cycle, and climate. Although humans and fire have always coexisted, our capacity to manage fire remains imperfect and may become more difficult in the future as climate change alters fire regimes. This risk is difficult to assess, however, because fires are still poorly represented in global models. Here, we discuss some of the most important issues involved in developing a better understanding of the role of fire in the Earth system.},

This work has shown the following limitations and advantages of phytolith analysis for the reconstruction of Mediterranean vegetation: (1) Phytoliths are produced in sufficient quantities for analysis and are well preserved in limestone environments, widespread in the Mediterranean area. (2) Young stands of Quercus ilex and Quercus coccifera, widely distributed in the Mediterranean area do not produce characteristic phytolith types in sufficient quantities to allow the calculation of a reliable index of tree cover density. (3) Pine forests, dominated by Pinus halepensis and Pinus sylvestris, are not recorded in the studied phytolith assemblages. (4) Grassland and shrubland assemblages can be distinguished through their associated phytolith assemblages, in particular by the proportion of crenate phytoliths produced in the short cells of the grass epidermis. (5) The different vegetation groups on the massif cannot be distinguished by pollen analysis. Further studies, comparing modern phytolith assemblages and quantitative vegetation data, should be carried out on forest plots that have been established for several centuries to further assess the role of phytolith analysis in vegetation reconstructions in the Mediterranean region.},

  abstract = {There is a known bias in C/N, δ13C and δ15N values of organic matter (OM) due to pre-analysis acid treatment methods. We report here, for the first time, the results of a pre-analysis acid treatment method comparison of measured C/N, δ13C and δ15N values in bulk OM from a sedimentary sequence of samples to illustrate this bias. Here we show that acid treatment significantly reduces the accuracy (between method biases) and precision (within method bias) of C/N, δ13C and δ15N values of OM, suggesting a differential response of sample OM between methods and sample horizons, and in some cases inefficient removal of inorganic carbon. We show that different methods can significantly influence environmental interpretation in some of our sample horizons (i.e. interpretation of aquatic vs. terrestrial OM source; C3 vs. C4 vegetation). Specifically, there are unpredictable and non-linear differences between methods for C/N values in the range of ∼1–100; δ13C values in the range of 0.2–6.8‰ and; δ15N values in the range of 0.3–0.7‰. Importantly, these ranges are mostly much greater than the instrument precision (defined as the standard deviation of replicate analysis of standard reference materials; for this study, ±0.5 for C/N values, ±0.1‰ for δ13C values and; ±0.1‰ for δ15N). The accuracy and precision of measured C/N, δ13C and δ15N values of bulk OM is not just dependent upon environmental variability, but on acid pre-treatment, residual inorganic carbon and organic matter state and composition. Collectively, this makes the correlation between samples prepared in different ways, including those from down-core reconstructions, highly questionable.},

  abstract = {Palaeoshorelines that lie submerged on stable continental shelves are relict coastal depositional and erosional structures formed during periods of lower sea level. An analysis of the well-dated Late Quaternary (0–128 ka) sea-level record indicates that the most persistent (modal) lower sea levels were at 30 – 40m below present, which occurred between 97 and 116 ka and at approximately 85 ka and 10 ka. A secondary modal position was at 70–90m that occurred mostly during a period of fluctuating sea level between 30 and 60 ka, as well as at around 87 ka (70 – 80m only) and 12−15 ka. For the tectonically stable Australian continental shelf, we show that a range of shorelines formed at each of these sea level modal positions and their morphology and degree of preservation depends on composition (carbonate vs siliciclastic) and oceanographic setting (wave, tide and wind energy). These ancient coasts record a range of oceanographic and geological regimes that existed during relatively long periods of lower sea level and provide a guide to the general depth zones in which similar features likely occur on other shelves globally. Australian palaeoshorelines represent distinctive benthic habitats that strongly influence the distribution of biodiversity across the shelf. Accurate mapping of these features provides a robust geospatial framework for investigations of marine species distributions and environmental change monitoring. These data also enable the better targeting of relict coastal areas that potentially include sand resources and sites of human occupation during periods of lower sea level.},

The proxy allows identification of wet and dry shifts in a complex sedimentary sequence comprised of peat, gyttja, laminated organic rich muds and fine clastic silt-rich sediments. Significant correlation is found between the XRF record and other proxies including magnetic susceptibility, humification, grain size, macrocharcoal, δ13C and C/N and pollen. Sixteen wetter periods are identified in the 37ka sedimentary record for Bromfield Swamp. Three wetter periods commence in late Marine Isotope Stage 3, nine in the early glacial, one in the late de-glacial and four in Holocene. Nineteen drier periods are identified, four in late MIS 3, seven in the early glacial, one during the LGM, one in the late de-glacial period and six in the Holocene. The XRF record for Bromfield Swamp is specifically used to identify periods of abrupt climate change. Marked changes in effective precipitation are detected at 32,690, 30,080, 24,660, 21,870, 11,880, 10,020, 9170 and 5120cal.yrBP. The detection of these abrupt climate events may allow correlation with records from terrestrial sites across the Southern Hemisphere and potentially, the Northern Hemisphere.},

  abstract = {Sediment grain size is a conventional proxy of climatic changes. Larger sediment grain size is often interpreted to indicate dry climate during lower lake level while smaller sediment grain size implies wet climate during higher lake level. Through detailed study on sediment grain sizes in Lake Erhai and Lake Chenghai, this paper reveals the different indication significances of sediment grain sizes in different time scales, different resolution investigations. For long time-scale and low resolution (102a or 103a) studies, larger sediment grain size indicates lower lake level, smaller lake area and drier climate while smaller sediment grain size indicates higher lake level, larger lake area and wetter climate. For short time-scale and high resolution (a or 10a) studies, larger sediment grain size reflects more rainfall and wetter climate while smaller sediment grain size reflects less rainfall and drier climate. Environmental information revealed by lacustrine sediment records is often different in different time scales because of the variance of sedimentation resolution, sampling resolution and dating precision. Therefore, paleoclimate implications of environmental proxies in long time-scale and low resolution investigations could not be mechanically applied to short time-scale and high resolution studies. Only after synthetically analyzing the influence manner and extent of all factors on the sediment records in different time scales, can credible conclusions be obtained.},

It is relevant to debates about when modern humans first dispersed out of Africa and when their descendants incorporated genetic material from Neanderthals, Denisovans and possibly other hominins. Humans have also been implicated in the extinction of Australia’s megafauna. Here we report the results of new excavations conducted at Madjedbebe, a rock shelter in northern Australia. Artefacts in primary depositional context are concentrated in three dense bands, with the stratigraphic integrity of the deposit demonstrated by artefact refits and by optical dating and other analyses of the sediments. Human occupation began around 65,000 years ago, with a distinctive stone tool assemblage including grinding stones, ground ochres, reflective additives and ground-edge hatchet heads. This evidence sets a new minimum age for the arrival of humans in Australia, the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and the subsequent interactions of modern humans with Neanderthals and Denisovans.},

The combination of paleoenvironmental proxy data from the cave indicates that between about 18,000 and 16,500 cal yr BP the cave area was dominated by an open plant community consisting of herbaceous vegetation, dominated by C               3               grasses, and scattered trees, primarily               Quercus               and               Pinus               species. After about 16,500 cal yr BP, the arboreal component fluctuated, attaining a peak between 14,000 and 13,000 cal yr BP with relatively equal proportions of C               3               and C               4               grasses, including a sizable proportion of Panicoideae grasses. The Younger Dryas is marked by a conspicuous decrease in arboreal pollen with an apparent increase of C               4               grasses toward its termination. Early Holocene recovery of arboreal vegetation is followed by a drying trend marked by the increasing dominance of C               4               drought-tolerant Chloridoideae grasses. Increasing human use of the cave in middle to late Holocene times creates noise in the climatic significance of pollen, phytolith, and other proxies, a factor to consider when interpreting paleoenvironmental proxies in other cave sedimentary records.},

  abstract = {Age-depth modeling using Bayesian statistics requires well-informed prior information about the behavior of sediment accumulation. Here we present average sediment accumulation rates (represented as deposition times, DT, in yr/cm) for lakes in an Arctic setting, and we examine the variability across space (intra- and inter-lake) and time (late Holocene). The dataset includes over 100 radiocarbon dates, primarily on bulk sediment, from 22 sediment cores obtained from 18 lakes spanning the boreal to tundra ecotone gradients in subarctic Canada. There are four to twenty-five radiocarbon dates per core, depending on the length and character of the sediment records. Deposition times were calculated at 100-year intervals from age-depth models constructed using the ‘classical’ age-depth modeling software Clam. Lakes in boreal settings have the most rapid accumulation (mean DT 20~±~10 yr/cm), whereas lakes in tundra settings accumulate at moderate (mean DT 70~±~10 yr/cm) to very slow rates, ({$>$}100~yr/cm). Many of the age-depth models demonstrate fluctuations in accumulation that coincide with lake evolution and post-glacial climate change. Ten of our sediment cores yielded sediments as old as c. 9000~cal BP (BP~=~years before AD 1950). From between c. 9000~cal BP and c. 6000~cal BP, sediment accumulation was relatively rapid (DT of 20–60~yr/cm). Accumulation slowed between c. 5500 and c. 4000~cal BP as vegetation expanded northward in response to warming. A short period of rapid accumulation occurred near 1200~cal BP at three lakes. Our research will help inform priors in Bayesian age modeling.},

Microfossils from terrestrial plants –~pollen, microcharcoal and phytoliths~– preserved in terrestrial and marine sedimentary archives are particularly useful tools to document changes in vegetation, fire and land climate. They are well-preserved in a variety of depositional environments and provide quantitative reconstructions of past land cover and climate. Those microfossil data are widely available from public archives, and their spatial coverage includes almost all regions on Earth, including both high and low latitudes and altitudes. Here, we (i) review the laboratory procedures used to extract those microfossils from sediment for microscopic observations and the qualitative and quantitative information they provide, (ii) highlight the importance of regional and global databases for large-scale syntheses of environmental changes, and (iii) review the application of terrestrial plant microfossil records in palaeoclimatology and palaeoecology using key examples from specific regions and past periods.},

  abstract = {Deep-sea core Fr10/95-GC17, collected offshore North West Cape at the western tip of Western Australia, is located beneath the path of the Leeuwin Current. This shallow, warm and low salinity current is an offshoot of the Indonesian Throughflow that transfers water and heat from the West Pacific Ocean into the Indian Ocean. The location is at the edge of the Indo Pacific Warm Pool, the source of large-scale transfer of moisture and heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. For this core, we combine previously published data with new research and use a revised chronology to re-examine the timing of climate change during the last 34,000 years in the tropics of northern Australia. The age model for the core is based on 15 radiocarbon dates complemented by luminescence ages and an oxygen isotope record. This study draws on an extensive range of analyses that have been performed on the core, including micropalaeontology of planktic and benthic foraminifera and coccoliths, stable isotopes analysis of foraminifera and their faunal composition, clay content, sediment composition and pollen analyses. Sea-surface and land temperatures are estimated from the foraminifer faunal analyses and from pollen spectra, respectively. The clay fraction and sediment composition and radiogenic isotopes of that fraction helped identify changes both on land and at sea: changes such as rainfall as shown by river discharge, and oceanic current tracing by neodymium, strontium and lead isotopes obtained from sediments. The most significant finding is that a major threshold was crossed at 13kaBP. Prior to that time, rainfall over NW Western Australia was low as was sea-surface temperature (SST); river discharge to the ocean was also low as a result of the lack of monsoonal activity and finally, ocean alkalinity would have been lower than at present due to the uptake of atmospheric CO2. By 13kaBP, the entire system moved away from glacial period conditions. The Indo-Australian monsoon commenced in and offshore northwestern Western Australia. SST and land temperature increased dramatically and ocean alkalinity changed due to the formation of a “barrier layer” (a low salinity cap), over the Indo Pacific Warm Pool. During the Holocene, river discharge and the land and ocean temperatures did not covary, for example, the highest rainfall did not coincide with the highest SST. Finally, the last 5ka saw a strengthening of ENSO in the region.},

  abstract = {In the Gulf of Carpentaria, northeastern Australia, 30 ka of lacustrine sedimentation provides a record of cyclic deposition of eolian dust (\&gt;60 μm) just preceding the Holocene. Adjacent layers containing eolian particles \&gt;60 μm in a core from Carpentaria relate to (perhaps intermittent) periods of eolian activity involving sediment deflation, and thus aridity, in northern Australia, each spanning at least 600 yr; major peaks of dust deposition occurred about every 2.25 ka. Such amplitude of cyclicity has already been recognized elsewhere on the globe for other phenomena, including waxing and waning of North American and European mountain glaciers, oxygen-isotope records from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores, changes in deep-sea benthic foraminiferal composition, oxygen-isotope records of deep-sea foraminifera, and atmospheric 14C variations. We propose that the cold Younger Dryas event that affected the Northern Hemisphere is matched by a significant dry event in the tropical region of northern Australia and that the timing of this event fits well into the ∼2.25 ka cyclic pattern described here. Thus, the Younger Dryas is a phenomenon of global significance and is not an "odd" event, contrary to current belief. In addition, we propose that activation of dunes in northeastern Australia, over periods of ∼600 yr, corresponds to, perhaps intermittently, stronger easterly trade winds. During such periods the Intertropical Convergence Zone may not have extended as far south as it does today.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of the Last Glacial period Indo-Australian summer monsoon (IASM) have revealed links to both northern and southern hemisphere high latitude climate as well as to regional ocean conditions. Particular interest has been paid to the monsoon response to Heinrich events, with variability explained by meridional shifts in positioning of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), but this model has not been adequately tested. In addition, the shorter-lived Dansgaard/Oeschger (D/O) events have not been detected (beyond D/O-1, the Bølling/Allerød) in land-based records from the Indo-Pacific, despite their prominent expression in stalagmites from southern Asia, raising questions about the sensitivity of the IASM to these events. Here we present a Southern Hemisphere stalagmite oxygen isotopic time series from Ball Gown Cave (BGC), tropical northern Australia, located on the margins of the modern austral summer ITCZ, that spans 40–31 and 27–8~ka. Elevated IASM rainfall coincides with Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas, while decreased rainfall characterizes D/O interstadials, a response that is anti-phased with sites spanning the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and with Chinese records of the East Asian summer monsoon. The BGC time series thus reveals a precipitation dipole consistent with a southward (northward) migration of the ITCZ during periods of high northern latitude cooling (warming) as the primary driver of millennial-scale IASM variability during the Last Glacial period. Our record indicates a strengthening of the IASM after the Younger Dryas period, likely as a result of rising sea level and sea surface temperatures, breaking the link with the high latitudes.},

  abstract = {Fractionation of carbon isotopes by plants during CO2 uptake and fixation (Δleaf) varies with environmental conditions, but quantitative patterns of Δleaf across environmental gradients at the global scale are lacking. This impedes interpretation of variability in ancient terrestrial organic matter, which encodes climatic and ecological signals. To address this problem, we converted 3,310 published leaf δ13C values into mean Δleaf values for 334 woody plant species at 105 locations (yielding 570 species-site combinations) representing a wide range of environmental conditions. Our analyses reveal a strong positive correlation between Δleaf and mean annual precipitation (MAP; R2 = 0.55), mirroring global trends in gross primary production and indicating stomatal constraints on leaf gas-exchange, mediated by water supply, are the dominant control of Δleaf at large spatial scales. Independent of MAP, we show a lesser, negative effect of altitude on Δleaf and minor effects of temperature and latitude. After accounting for these factors, mean Δleaf of evergreen gymnosperms is lower (by 1–2.7‰) than for other woody plant functional types (PFT), likely due to greater leaf-level water-use efficiency. Together, environmental and PFT effects contribute to differences in mean Δleaf of up to 6‰ between biomes. Coupling geologic indicators of ancient precipitation and PFT (or biome) with modern Δleaf patterns has potential to yield more robust reconstructions of atmospheric δ13C values, leading to better constraints on past greenhouse-gas perturbations. Accordingly, we estimate a 4.6‰ decline in the δ13C of atmospheric CO2 at the onset of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, an abrupt global warming event ∼55.8 Ma.},

However, despite substantial progress, events that are unprecedented in the local observational record remain a persistent challenge. Leveraging observations and a large climate model ensemble, we quantify uncertainty in the influence of global warming on the severity and probability of the historically hottest month, hottest day, driest year, and wettest 5-d period for different areas of the globe. We find that historical warming has increased the severity and probability of the hottest month and hottest day of the year at {$>$}80\% of the available observational area. Our framework also suggests that the historical climate forcing has increased the probability of the driest year and wettest 5-d period at 57\% and 41\% of the observed area, respectively, although we note important caveats. For the most protracted hot and dry events, the strongest and most widespread contributions of anthropogenic climate forcing occur in the tropics, including increases in probability of at least a factor of 4 for the hottest month and at least a factor of 2 for the driest year. We also demonstrate the ability of our framework to systematically evaluate the role of dynamic and thermodynamic factors such as atmospheric circulation patterns and atmospheric water vapor, and find extremely high statistical confidence that anthropogenic forcing increased the probability of record-low Arctic sea ice extent.},

  abstract = {Leaf-wax hydrogen isotope composition (delta D (sub wax) ) is increasingly applied as a proxy for hydroclimate variability in tropical paleoclimate archives, but the factors controlling delta D (sub wax) in the tropics remain poorly understood. We measured delta D (sub wax) and the stable carbon isotope composition of leaf-waxes (delta (super 13) C (sub wax) ), including both n-alkanes and n-alkanoic acids, from modern lake sediments and soils across a marked aridity gradient in southeastern Mexico and northern Central America to investigate the importance of aridity and vegetation composition on delta D (sub wax) . In this region the estimated hydrogen isotope composition of meteoric water (delta D (sub w) ) varies by only 25 ppm, and variability in delta D (sub w) does not explain the relatively large variance in delta D (sub wax) (60 ppm). Instead, the aridity index, defined as the ratio of mean annual precipitation to mean annual potential evapotranspiration (MAP/PET), explains much of the variability in the hydrogen isotope fractionation between leaf-waxes and meteoric water (epsilon (sub wax/w) ). Aridity effects are more evident in lake sediments than in soils, possibly because integration of leaf-waxes across a broad catchment masks small-scale variability in epsilon (sub wax/w) that is a consequence of differences in vegetation and microclimates. In angiosperm-dominated environments, plant ecology, inferred from delta (super 13) C (sub wax) , provides a secondary control on epsilon (sub wax/w) for n-alkanoic acids (epsilon (sub n-acid/w) ). Low delta (super 13) C (sub n-acid) values are associated with high epsilon (sub n-acid/w) values, most likely reflecting differences in biosynthetic hydrogen isotope fractionation between C (sub 4) grasses and C (sub 3) trees and shrubs. A similar relationship between delta (super 13) C (sub n-alkane) and epsilon (sub n-alkane/w) is not observed. These results indicate that changes in either aridity or vegetation can cause large variability in delta D (sub wax) that is independent of the isotopic composition of precipitation, and these effects should be accounted for in paleoclimate studies.

  abstract = {Given the recent history of frequent and extensive late dry season wildfire in Australia’s fire-prone northern savannas, regional conservation-based fire management programs typically aim to mitigate wildfire through the use of strategic prescribed burning during the cooler early dry season. However, it remains unclear as to the extent such environmental management concerns are being addressed by these renewed fire management efforts. This study documents changes in fire regime in the western Arnhem Land region of northern Australia associated with the implementation of active fire management since 2006. Over a 12-year period, the regional fire regime has transitioned from late dry season, wildfire-dominated to being characterised by a majority of fires occurring as small early dry season prescribed burns. Although overall area burnt has not significantly decreased, most ecological threshold metrics have improved, with the exception of those describing the maintenance of longer-unburnt habitat. Challenges involved with defining, delivering, monitoring and evaluating heterogeneity targets are discussed.},

  abstract = {Global climate variability during the late Quaternary is commonly investigated within the framework of the ‘bipolar seesaw’ pattern of asynchronous temperature variations in the northern and southern polar latitudes. The terrestrial hydrological response to this pattern in south-eastern Australia is not fully understood, as continuous, high-resolution, well-dated proxy records for the hydrological cycle in the region are sparse. Here we present a well-dated, highly resolved record of moisture balance spanning 30000–10000 calendar years before present (30–10 ka BP), based on x-ray fluorescence and organic carbon isotope (δ13COM) measurements of a sedimentary sequence from Lake Surprise in south-eastern Australia. The data provide a locally coherent record of the hydrological cycle. Elevated Si (reflecting windblown quartz and clays), and relatively high δ13COM, indicate an extended period of relative aridity between 28 and 18.5 ka BP, interrupted by millennial-scale episodes of decreased Si and δ13COM, suggesting increased moisture balance. This was followed by a rapid deglacial shift to low Si and δ13COM at 18.5 ka BP, indicative of wetter conditions. We find that these changes are coeval with other records from south-eastern Australia and New Zealand, and use a Monte Carlo Empirical Orthogonal Function approach to extract a common trend from three high-resolution records. Our analyses suggest that drivers of the regional hydrological cycle have varied on multi-millennial time scales, in response to major shifts in global atmosphere-ocean dynamics during the last glacial-interglacial transition. Southern Ocean processes were the dominant control on hydroclimate during glacial times, via a strong influence of cold sea surface temperatures on moisture uptake and delivery onshore. Following the last deglaciation (around 18 ka BP), the southward migration of cold Southern Ocean fronts likely resulted in the establishment of conditions more like those of the present day. Millennial-scale variability in records from the region is dominated by a persistent ca. 2300-year periodicity, consistent with other records across the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes; however, this pervasive periodicity is not obviously linked to the ‘bipolar seesaw’ and the mechanism remains equivocal.},

  abstract = {At present, knowledge of late Quaternary variability of the Indonesian-Australian summer monsoon in the Australian tropics is limited. Organic spring deposits, which occur throughout the Kimberley region of northwest Australia, are valuable archives that contain records spanning the past ∼14,500 years. In this study we compare multiple proxies from three organic springs. Principal Components Analyses demonstrates similar patterns of change in the elemental and non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) datasets between the springs, implying regional drivers are responsible for changes in these proxies. By comparison, the pollen records differ between each of the springs, with the assemblage at each thought to be influenced by spring recharge and evolution rather than climate variability. In order to empirically and objectively assess the synchronicity of changes, we applied Monte Carlo empirical orthogonal function (MCEOF) analysis to one variable in each μXRF and NPP dataset (Si/Ti ratios and Pseudoschizaea accumulation rates, as these proxies are expected to reflect hydrological conditions in springs) to assess regional patterns of change in site moisture. This analysis revealed periods of increased monsoonal precipitation from ∼14,500–7500 cal. yr BP corresponding with deglacial sea level rise, high orbital tilt coupled with warmer sea surface temperatures, and with possible links to a southward migration of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during the Younger Dryas. Monsoonal precipitation was reduced from 7500 cal. yr BP coinciding with the culmination of deglacial sea level rise and a possible northward shift in the mean position of the ITCZ, in addition to between 2600 and 1000 cal. yr BP corresponding with increased moderate-to-strong ENSO events.},

  abstract = {The timing and nature of hunter-gather exploitation of tropical rainforests is a topic of ongoing debate. In contrast to most other tropical regions, permanent settlement in Australian rainforests developed much later, and in the absence of adjacent agricultural economies. Here we explore how the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland were exploited during the late Holocene through an ancient starch and phytolith record spanning the last 2000years. Sequences at the two sites under study – Urumbal Pocket (a ‘Eucalyptus pocket’ surrounded by rainforest) and Goddard Creek (within the rainforest) – indicate a human presence since the early Holocene, coincident with the re-establishment of rainforest in the region. Toxic starchy nuts and the associated complex processing underpinned permanent settlement. Using a geometric morphometric approach to starch analysis, a range of economic starch producing plant species were identified including Endiandra palmerstonii, E. insignis, Lasjia whelani and Beilschmiedia bancroftii in the Urumbal pocket sequence. The phytolith record shows that Urumbal Pocket has been a ‘Eucalyptus pocket’ for at least the last 2000years, the open nature of the vegetation maintained by regular burning. Goddard Creek, on the other hand has been closed forest, with a changing profile as fire was used more frequently over time. The starch and phytolith sequence provide a unique insight into the local history of these rainforest archaeological sites, with a record that can be viewed against the backdrop of regional sequences documenting climatic and environmental patterns during the late Holocene.},

  abstract = {Extreme droughts, heat waves, frosts, precipitation, wind storms and other climate extremes may impact the structure, composition and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and thus carbon cycling and its feedbacks to the climate system. Yet, the interconnected avenues through which climate extremes drive ecological and physiological processes and alter the carbon balance are poorly understood. Here, we review the literature on carbon cycle relevant responses of ecosystems to extreme climatic events. Given that impacts of climate extremes are considered disturbances, we assume the respective general disturbance-induced mechanisms and processes to also operate in an extreme context. The paucity of well-defined studies currently renders a quantitative meta-analysis impossible, but permits us to develop a deductive framework for identifying the main mechanisms (and coupling thereof) through which climate extremes may act on the carbon cycle. We find that ecosystem responses can exceed the duration of the climate impacts via lagged effects on the carbon cycle. The expected regional impacts of future climate extremes will depend on changes in the probability and severity of their occurrence, on the compound effects and timing of different climate extremes, and on the vulnerability of each land-cover type modulated by management. Although processes and sensitivities differ among biomes, based on expert opinion, we expect forests to exhibit the largest net effect of extremes due to their large carbon pools and fluxes, potentially large indirect and lagged impacts, and long recovery time to regain previous stocks. At the global scale, we presume that droughts have the strongest and most widespread effects on terrestrial carbon cycling. Comparing impacts of climate extremes identified via remote sensing vs. ground-based observational case studies reveals that many regions in the (sub-)tropics are understudied. Hence, regional investigations are needed to allow a global upscaling of the impacts of climate extremes on global carbon–climate feedbacks.},

Although many studies of contamination removal from macroscopic charcoals from tephra sequences have been made, little attention has been paid to those containing no visible charcoal, because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient carbon for radiometric dating. We report here experiments using accelerator mass spectrometry to establish a reliable method for dating a low-carbon aeolian and peat deposit containing a tephra horizon. Results so far demonstrate that improvements to existing chemical pretreatment methods are possible, and that dates obtained on oxidized fine-grained residues can approach the maximum age determined on good quality chaffed wood samples.},

  abstract = {We present a precisely dated, multi-proxy stalagmite record from Liang Luar Cave, Flores (southeast Indonesia) that reveals a rapid increase in Indonesian monsoon rainfall at ∼9.5~ka. A “ramp-fitting” method for detecting statistically significant inflections in a time-series was applied to the stalagmite δ18O, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca profiles to quantify the precise timing and magnitude of an abrupt increase in monsoon strength over a period of ∼350~years. Previously published lake-level records from the monsoon-affected Australian interior show a sudden intensification of the Australian monsoon at ∼14~ka. However, our records indicate that monsoon intensification in Flores occured ∼4–5~kyr later. The timing of the monsoon shift in Flores is synchronous with the rapid expansion of rainforest in northeast Australia and regional freshening of the southern Makassar Strait which, under present-day conditions, is sensitive to monsoon variability. The freshening of southern Makassar was coeval with an abrupt ∼1.5~°C cooling in the upper thermocline of the Timor Sea ∼9.5~ka, indicative of reduced surface heat transport by the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) when the Java Sea opened during postglacial sea-level rise. This suggests that the abrupt increase in monsoon rainfall on Flores was not due to a change in the ITF – because a decrease in rainfall would be expected to accompany cooler local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) – but rather by the sudden increase in ocean surface area and/or temperature in the monsoon source region as the Sunda Shelf flooded during deglaciation. We propose that it was the abrupt intensification of the monsoon through the late deglaciation that maintained the subsequent structure of the ITF following the flooding of the Sunda Shelf at ∼9.5~ka.},

  abstract = {It is well known that, during the widely used AAA pretreatment (de Vries and Barendsen 1954), alkali treatment is responsible for the incorporation of modern carbon due to the precipitation of atmospheric CO2 as carbonate. Until now, the last step of the experiment, consisting in acid treatment (most of the time with hydrochloric acid) was considered to be sufficient to eliminate all of lab contamination. But wood, peat and sediment present a complex molecular structure. During radiocarbon chemical treatments, functional groups still present in the molecules are likely to form ionic bonds with “modern” carbonates. These new chemical bonds resist a “classical” acid treatment and are responsible for rejuvenation. This short paper presents preliminary results for two common 14C cases: rejuvenation of a 0.4 pMC wood and of an Oxygen Isotope Stage 3 (OIS3) paleosol. For both cases, contamination due to incorporation of modern carbon during chemical treatment is evaluated and an alternative protocol is proposed.},

Following a dry Younger Dryas, a period of increased precipitation and riverine discharge occurred during the Holocene 'thermal maximum.' Since ∼5400 years ago, a trend toward drier conditions is evident from the data, with high-amplitude fluctuations and precipitation minima during the time interval 3800 to 2800 years ago and during the 'Little Ice Age.' These regional changes in precipitation are best explained by shifts in the mean latitude of the Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), potentially driven by Pacific-based climate variability. The Cariaco Basin record exhibits strong correlations with climate records from distant regions, including the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere, providing evidence for global teleconnections among regional climates.},

  abstract = {Climate change is impacting global surface water resources, increasing the need for a deeper understanding of the interaction between climate and biological diversity. This is particularly the case in the Southern Hemisphere sub-tropics, where little information exists on the aquatic biota response to climate variations. Palaeolimnological techniques, in particular the use of diatoms, are well established and can significantly contribute to the understanding of climatic variability and the impacts that change in climate have on aquatic ecosystems. A sediment core from Lake McKenzie, Fraser Island (Australia), was used to investigate interactions between climate influences and aquatic ecosystems. This study utilises a combination of proxies including biological (diatom), geochemical and chronological techniques to investigate long-term aquatic changes within the perched-dune lake. A combination of 210Pb and AMS 14C dates showed that the retrieved sediment represented a history of ca. 37,000cal.yBP. The sedimentation rate in Lake McKenzie is very low, ranging on average from 0.11mm to 0.26mm per year. A sediment hiatus was observed between ca. 18,300 and 14,000cal.yBP suggesting a period of dry conditions at the site. The diatom record shows little variability over the period of record, with benthic, freshwater acidic tolerant species dominating. Relative abundance of planktonic species and geochemical results indicates a period of increased water depth and lake productivity in the early Holocene and a gradual decrease in effective precipitation throughout the Holocene. Results from this study not only support earlier work conducted on Fraser Island using pollen reconstructions but also demonstrate that diatom community diversity has been relatively consistent throughout the Holocene and late Pleistocene with only minor cyclical fluctuation evident. This record is consistent with the few other aquatic palaeoecological records from the Southern Hemisphere sub-tropics.},

  abstract = {Birth of the Cool Over the past 4 million years or so, tropical sea surface temperatures have experienced a cooling trend (see the Perspective by Philander). Herbert et al. (p. 1530) analyzed sea surface temperature records of the past 3.5 million years from low-latitude sites spanning the world's major ocean basins in order to determine the timing and magnitude of the cooling that has accompanied the intensification of Northern Hemisphere ice ages since the Pliocene. Martínez-Garcia et al. (p. 1550) found that the enigmatic eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue, a feature one might not expect to find in such a warm region receiving so much sunlight, first appeared between 1.8 and 1.2 million years ago. Its appearance was probably in response to a general shrinking of the tropical warm water pool caused by general climate cooling driven by changes in Earth's orbit. Determining the timing and amplitude of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) change is an important part of solving the puzzle of the Plio-Pleistocene ice ages. Alkenone-based tropical SST records from the major ocean basins show coherent glacial-interglacial temperature changes of 1° to 3°C that align with (but slightly lead) global changes in ice volume and deep ocean temperature over the past 3.5 million years. Tropical temperatures became tightly coupled with benthic δ18O and orbital forcing after 2.7 million years. We interpret the similarity of tropical SST changes, in dynamically dissimilar regions, to reflect “top-down” forcing through the atmosphere. The inception of a strong carbon dioxide–greenhouse gas feedback and amplification of orbital forcing at \textasciitilde 2.7 million years ago connected the fate of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets with global ocean temperatures since that time. Tropical sea surface temperatures were controlled more by atmospheric connections to glaciation cycles than by ocean circulation.

  abstract = {Over the past several decades, high-resolution sediment–charcoal records have been increasingly used to reconstruct local fire history. Data analysis methods usually involve a decomposition that detrends a charcoal series and then applies a threshold value to isolate individual peaks, which are interpreted as fire episodes. Despite the proliferation of these studies, methods have evolved largely in the absence of a thorough statistical framework. We describe eight alternative decomposition models (four detrending methods used with two threshold-determination methods) and evaluate their sensitivity to a set of known parameters integrated into simulated charcoal records. Results indicate that the combination of a globally defined threshold with specific detrending methods can produce strongly biased results, depending on whether or not variance in a charcoal record is stationary through time. These biases are largely eliminated by using a locally defined threshold, which adapts to changes in variability throughout a charcoal record. Applying the alternative decomposition methods on three previously published charcoal records largely supports our conclusions from simulated records. We also present a minimum-count test for empirical records, which reduces the likelihood of false positives when charcoal counts are low. We conclude by discussing how to evaluate when peak detection methods are warranted with a given sediment–charcoal record.},

  abstract = {This study summarizes the results of radiocarbon dating and age-depth modelling in four mountain lakes (Brazi, Gales, Bucura and Lia) in the Retezat Mountains. Altogether 69 AMS 14C measurements were performed on these deposits, mostly on terrestrial plant macrofossils. In several cases, plant macrofossils, aquatic animal remains (Cladoceran eggs) and bulk sediment were measured from the same depth allowing for the comparison of various sediment components in terms of their dating potential. Age-depth models were developed using both Bayesian modelling with the BACON and smooth spline curve fitting with the CLAM software. In this study Bayesian models are applied to identify outlier 14C dates, while smooth spline models are used to model sediment accumulation age-depth relations, as these are more likely to follow natural deposition time changes of lake sediments. Changes in sediment deposition times (DT) in relation to catchment size and climate are also studied. DT varied considerably in the late glacial (LG) part of the records. The sediment sequence characterised by high deposition rates during the late glacial (DT maximum around 100–110~years~cm−1) was defined by small catchment size (Lake Brazi, 6~ha; surface area: 0.5~ha). In contrast, much slower LG sediment deposition in the southern slope lake characterised by large catchment area (Lake Lia, 171~ha, 20~years~cm−1), principally reflecting strong erosion in these catchment areas at times when vegetation cover was scarce. Holocene was characterised again by variable DT values, but only Lake Gales showed extreme values: 62–110 years between 10,900 and 6050~cal~yr~BP, followed by much slower sediment deposition in the last 6000 years (av. 29~years~cm−1). Generally, sediment deposition times were largely dependent on the stability and vegetation cover of the slope in the case of high altitude deep lakes, while lower altitude, shallow lakes showed slower sediment deposition time in the early and mid-Holocene, when summer insolation was higher than today. This reflects that in these shallow lakes in-lake organic production probably increased with summer insolation, which was a significant driver in the rate of deposition.},

The lack of data is due partially to the paucity of lakes that contain carbonate sediment suitable for oxygen-isotopic analysis. We report here the first record of oxygen-isotopic composition in diatom silica (δ18OSi) from a lake in that region. δ18OSi increases gradually from 19.0 to 23.5‰ between 12,340 and 11,000 14C yr B.P., reflecting marked climatic warming at the end of the last glaciation. Around 11,000 14C yr B.P., δ18OSi decreases by 1.7‰, suggesting a temperature decrease of 3.5–8.9 °C at the onset of the Younger Dryas (YD) in southwestern Alaska. Climatic recovery began ca. 10,740 14C yr B.P., as inferred from the increase of δ18OSi to a maximum of 23.9‰ near the end of the YD. Our data reveal that a YD climatic reversal in southwestern coastal areas of Alaska occurred, but the YD climate did not return to full-glacial conditions.},

  abstract = {During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), ice volume reached a relative maximum and global temperature was lower than today. Understanding continental ice volume change requires accurate reconstruction of relative sea level, but tectonic uplift and isostatic adjustment effects complicate many records. Using marine sediment cores from the Bonaparte Gulf in northwestern Australia, a so-called “far field” tectonically stable site, Yokoyama et~al. (2000) reported that the LGM terminated abruptly at 19~ka with a rapid sea-level rise (19~ka event). Their sea-level reconstruction determined the age of the LGM termination, but the timing of its inception remained less well constrained, partly because the number of radiocarbon analyses was insufficient to clarify LGM duration. Here we return to the Bonaparte Gulf and present a new relative sea level that better constrains LGM duration with high-resolution radiocarbon dating of a recently recovered marine sediment core (water depth: 120~m, length: 583~cm). Radiocarbon dating of 23 molluscs and 26 bulk organic-matter samples, together with total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and stable carbon isotopes, provide a record of paleoenvironmental variability in response to sea level change. Our results indicate that the LGM sea-level minimum occurred at 20.8~cal~ka~BP and the LGM duration was shorter than previously reported.},

  abstract = {Maritime Continent (MC) convection drives zonal and meridional climate modes, including the Australasian monsoon system, but its role in past global climate change remains uncertain. Here we use speleothem oxygen isotope (δ18O) records from a latitudinal transect across the MC, and a new critically located record for southwest Sulawesi, Indonesia, to reconstruct spatial hydroclimate variability in the Australasian monsoon domain over the last 40,000 yr. Our results show that atmospheric convection in the core MC region was reduced from ∼40,000 to 12,000 yr ago and strengthened rapidly only after the inundation of shallow continental shelves in the region, well after the onset of deglaciation. Interestingly, the millennial-scale climatic impacts of North Atlantic Heinrich events are not evident in Sulawesi. Together with climate model simulations, we demonstrate that changes in deep atmospheric convection dominate glacial–interglacial hydroclimate over the MC, whereas latitudinal shifts in the mean location of the InterTropical Convergence Zone control rainfall patterns during abrupt climate changes.},

Here we integrate high-resolution riverine runoff and dust proxy data from X-ray fluorescence scanner measurements in four well-dated sediment cores, forming a NE–SW transect across the Timor Sea. Our records reveal that the development of the Australian monsoon closely followed the deglacial warming history of Antarctica. A minimum in riverine runoff documents dry conditions throughout the region during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (15–12.9\,ka). Massive intensification of the monsoon coincided with Southern Hemisphere warming and intensified greenhouse forcing over Australia during the atmospheric CO2 rise at 12.9–10\,ka. We relate the earlier onset of the monsoon in the Timor Strait (13.4\,ka) to regional changes in landmass exposure during deglacial sea-level rise. A return to dryer conditions occurred between 8.1 and 7.3\,ka following the early Holocene runoff maximum.},

  abstract = {Several areas of earth science require knowledge of the fluctuations in sea level and ice volume through glacial cycles. These include understanding past ice sheets and providing boundary conditions for paleoclimate models, calibrating marine-sediment isotopic records, and providing the background signal for evaluating anthropogenic contributions to sea level. From ∼1,000 observations of sea level, allowing for isostatic and tectonic contributions, we have quantified the rise and fall in global ocean and ice volumes for the past 35,000 years. Of particular note is that during the ∼6,000 y up to the start of the recent rise ∼100−150 y ago, there is no evidence for global oscillations in sea level on time scales exceeding ∼200 y duration or 15−20 cm amplitude.The major cause of sea-level change during ice ages is the exchange of water between ice and ocean and the planet’s dynamic response to the changing surface load. Inversion of ∼1,000 observations for the past 35,000 y from localities far from former ice margins has provided new constraints on the fluctuation of ice volume in this interval. Key results are: (i) a rapid final fall in global sea level of ∼40 m in \&lt;2,000 y at the onset of the glacial maximum ∼30,000 y before present (30 ka BP); (ii) a slow fall to −134 m from 29 to 21 ka BP with a maximum grounded ice volume of ∼52 × 106 km3 greater than today; (iii) after an initial short duration rapid rise and a short interval of near-constant sea level, the main phase of deglaciation occurred from ∼16.5 ka BP to ∼8.2 ka BP at an average rate of rise of 12 m⋅ka−1 punctuated by periods of greater, particularly at 14.5–14.0 ka BP at ≥40 mm⋅y−1 (MWP-1A), and lesser, from 12.5 to 11.5 ka BP (Younger Dryas), rates; (iv) no evidence for a global MWP-1B event at ∼11.3 ka BP; and (v) a progressive decrease in the rate of rise from 8.2 ka to ∼2.5 ka BP, after which ocean volumes remained nearly constant until the renewed sea-level rise at 100–150 y ago, with no evidence of oscillations exceeding ∼15–20 cm in time intervals ≥200 y from 6 to 0.15 ka BP.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis that the late Holocene climate of northern Australia has been characterised by periods of reduced rainfall has been examined by constructing a detailed chronostratigraphy of climatically sensitive geomorphological sites, in particular dunefields and lake deposits. There is clear evidence of aridity during the last glacial period (c. 18,000 BP), and disturbance of coastal deposits by rising sea level until 5500 BP. Following the flooding of the shallow Sunda and Sahul shelves, the climate of northern Australia appears to have become increasingly variable with an arid trend interrupted by periods of increased rainfall between 3500 and 2800 BP, again between 2100 and 1600 BP and possibly twice during the last 1000 years. It is proposed that the dry episodes are associated with persistent, large‐scale sinking, dry south‐easterly flows over the Australian tropics inhibiting the onset of the north Australian monsoon. These are similar to flows associated with present‐day ENSO events. The pattern suggests that ENSO may be associated with a larger process which may not have begun to operate until the flooding of the shallow Sunda and Sahul shelves and the opening of the Indonesian throughflow between the Pacific and Indian oceans.},

Both coarse fraction and fine fraction TL methods were used. Seventeen TL dates were measured. None of the TL dates contradict the ages given by radiocarbon. Where multiple TL dates were taken from a unit, they overlap within 2 standard deviation giving added confidence in the results. A phase of dune emplacement during the late Holocene (ca. 2700-1800 yr B.P.) was identified in two of the dune-fields, an early Holocene phase of dune emplacement (ca. 8600-7500 yr B.P.) in two of the dune-fields, and a late Pleistocene episode (ca. 24,000–17,000 yr B.P.) in both the Cape York dunefields. Three older units gave dates of about 29,000, 81,000, and 171,000 yr B.P., but these must be treated with caution.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the possible teleconnections between abrupt climatic changes originating in the North Atlantic and precipitation dynamics in the Australian–Indonesian summer monsoon (AISM) domain. We examine the climatic impacts of Heinrich stadial 3 (HS3) and Greenland interstadials 4 and 3 (GIS4/3) on AISM-associated precipitation through a high-resolution analysis of stable isotope (δ18O, δ13C) and trace element (Mg/Ca, P/Ca) ratios in a stalagmite from Liang Luar cave, Flores, Indonesia. Sixteen high precision 230Th dates indicate that stalagmite LR07-E1 grew rapidly (\textasciitilde 0.3–1.0mm/yr) in two phases between \textasciitilde 31.5–30.1ka and \textasciitilde 27.8–25.6ka, separated by a \textasciitilde 2.3kyr unconformity. Temporally consistent abrupt responses occur in the Flores record during HS3 and GIS4, which are coherent with changes in stalagmite δ18O records from China and Brazil. The response of low-latitude precipitation to HS3 cooling and GIS4 warming, as demonstrated by the widely separated sites, comprises three distinct simplified phases: (1) a strong southward migration of the ITCZ during HS3 is associated with a decrease in rainfall at Liang Luar cave and in China, while wetter conditions are reconstructed from Brazil, (2) represents the peak of HS3 impacts and an extended hiatus begins in the Flores record and (3) where suggested dry conditions at Liang Luar throughout GIS4 form part of a coherent north–south anti-phasing in precipitation changes. The reconstructed changes are also broadly consistent with NASA GISS ModelE-R simulations of a Heinrich-like freshwater perturbation in the North Atlantic basin, which produces a southward shift in the ITCZ. The relationship between the palaeoclimate records indicates that atmospheric teleconnections rapidly propagate and synchronise climate change across the hemispheres during periods of abrupt climate change. Our findings augment recent proposals that large-scale atmospheric re-organisations during stadials and interstadials play a key role in driving changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration, air temperature and global climate change.},

  abstract = {It has been known since Rhodes Fairbridge’s first attempt to establish a global pattern of Holocene sea-level change by combining evidence from Western Australia and from sites in the northern hemisphere that the details of sea-level history since the Last Glacial Maximum vary considerably across the globe. The Australian region is relatively stable tectonically and is situated in the ‘far-field’ of former ice sheets. It therefore preserves important records of post-glacial sea levels that are less complicated by neotectonics or glacio-isostatic adjustments. Accordingly, the relative sea-level record of this region is dominantly one of glacio-eustatic (ice equivalent) sea-level changes. The broader Australasian region has provided critical information on the nature of post-glacial sea level, including the termination of the Last Glacial Maximum when sea level was approximately 125m lower than present around 21,000–19,000 years BP, and insights into meltwater pulse 1A between 14,600 and 14,300cal.yrBP. Although most parts of the Australian continent reveals a high degree of tectonic stability, research conducted since the 1970s has shown that the timing and elevation of a Holocene highstand varies systematically around its margin. This is attributed primarily to variations in the timing of the response of the ocean basins and shallow continental shelves to the increased ocean volumes following ice-melt, including a process known as ocean siphoning (i.e. glacio-hydro-isostatic adjustment processes). Several seminal studies in the early 1980s produced important data sets from the Australasian region that have provided a solid foundation for more recent palaeo-sea-level research. This review revisits these key studies emphasising their continuing influence on Quaternary research and incorporates relatively recent investigations to interpret the nature of post-glacial sea-level change around Australia. These include a synthesis of research from the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia. A focus of these more recent studies has been the re-examination of: (1) the accuracy and reliability of different proxy sea-level indicators; (2) the rate and nature of post-glacial sea-level rise; (3) the evidence for timing, elevation, and duration of mid-Holocene highstands; and, (4) the notion of mid- to late Holocene sea-level oscillations, and their basis. Based on this synthesis of previous research, it is clear that estimates of past sea-surface elevation are a function of eustatic factors as well as morphodynamics of individual sites, the wide variety of proxy sea-level indicators used, their wide geographical range, and their indicative meaning. Some progress has been made in understanding the variability of the accuracy of proxy indicators in relation to their contemporary sea level, the inter-comparison of the variety of dating techniques used and the nuances of calibration of radiocarbon ages to sidereal years. These issues need to be thoroughly understood before proxy sea-level indicators can be incorporated into credible reconstructions of relative sea-level change at individual locations. Many of the issues, which challenged sea-level researchers in the latter part of the twentieth century, remain contentious today. Divergent opinions remain about: (1) exactly when sea level attained present levels following the most recent post-glacial marine transgression (PMT); (2) the elevation that sea-level reached during the Holocene sea-level highstand; (3) whether sea-level fell smoothly from a metre or more above its present level following the PMT; (4) whether sea level remained at these highstand levels for a considerable period before falling to its present position; or (5) whether it underwent a series of moderate oscillations during the Holocene highstand.},

  abstract = {The South Wellesley Islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia, were the recent focus of a palynological investigation which found vegetation change during the Holocene was driven by coastal progradation and regional climate. Here, we present new elemental data from x-ray fluorescence core scanning which provides non-destructive, continuous and high resolution analysis from three wetlands across Bentinck Island, the largest of the South Wellesley Islands. Elemental data and grain size analyses are combined with lead-210 (210Pb) and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) carbon-14 (14C) dates. An open coastal environment was present 1250 cal. a BP on the south east coast of Bentinck Island, with sediment supply incorporating fluvial deposition and detrital input of titanium and iron from eroding lateritic bedrock. Prograding shorelines, dune development and river diversion formed a series of swales parallel to the coast by \textasciitilde 800 cal. a BP, forming the Marralda wetlands. Wetlands developed at sites on the north and west coasts \textasciitilde 500 and \textasciitilde 450 cal. a BP, respectively. Geochemical and grain size analyses indicate that wetlands formed as accreting tidal mudflats or within inter-dune swales that intercepted groundwater draining to the coastal margins. The timing of wetland initiation indicates localised late-Holocene sea level regression, stabilisation and coastal plain development in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Elemental data provide new records of wetland development across Bentinck Island, highlighting the value of a multi-proxy approach to understanding environmental change during the Holocene in tropical northern Australia.},

  abstract = {This study presents three records of environmental change during the late-Holocene from wetlands across Bentinck Island in the South Wellesley Islands, northern Australia. Radiometric dating provided ages for sediment cores with the longest chronology spanning the last 1250 cal. yr BP. Palynological results show the diverse mangrove community transitioned to woodland- and wetland-dominated vegetation over the last 850\,years on the southeast coast. The key driver of this landscape change was likely late-Holocene sea level regression and coastal progradation in the Gulf of Carpentaria. This study found freshwater wetlands expanded across Bentick Island over the last 500\,years, with sedges and rushes peaking in the last 350\,years. Macroscopic and microscopic charcoal records, coupled with archaeological evidence, highlights the spatial and temporal variation in fire regimes across the island, reflecting the traditional fire management practices of the Kaiadilt people during the late-Holocene. This study finds a significant increase in charcoal accumulation in the 1900s when Kaiadilt fire practices were disrupted and the South Wellesley Islands were abandoned. The pollen record reflects little change in the vegetation despite the shifting fire regime, highlighting the importance of multi-proxy approaches to reconstructing past environments in tropical northern Australia where vegetation is adapted to fire.},

  abstract = {We synthesize existing sedimentary charcoal records to reconstruct Holocene fire history at regional, continental and global scales. The reconstructions are compared with the two potential controls of burning at these broad scales – changes in climate and human activities – to assess their relative importance on trends in biomass burning. Here we consider several hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the Holocene record of fire, including climate, human activities and synergies between the two. Our results suggest that 1) episodes of high fire activity were relatively common in the early Holocene and were consistent with climate changes despite low global temperatures and low levels of biomass burning globally; 2) there is little evidence from the paleofire record to support the Early Anthropocene Hypothesis of human modification of the global carbon cycle; 3) there was a nearly-global increase in fire activity from 3 to 2~ka that is difficult to explain with either climate or humans, but the widespread and synchronous nature of the increase suggests at least a partial climate forcing; and 4) burning during the past century generally decreased but was spatially variable; it declined sharply in many areas, but there were also large increases (e.g., Australia and parts of Europe). Our analysis does not exclude an important role for human activities on global biomass burning during the Holocene, but instead provides evidence for a pervasive influence of climate across multiple spatial and temporal scales.},

  abstract = {Swamps in the seasonal tropics have good potential for the reconstruction of late Quaternary monsoonal dynamics. Their successful use, however, has often been compromised by chronological limitations introduced by a variety of depositional and post-depositional processes actively modifying the swamp deposits. We here present and discuss the results of a multiple dating approach at Table Top Swamp (TTS) in northern Australia (the ‘Top End’). Single-grain luminescence dating of quartz was successfully used to provide chronology in the lowermost core where insufficient organic material prevents the application of radiocarbon dating. In the uppermost, fine-grained and peaty section of the core, two different organic fractions (pollen concentrate and humins) were dated with AMS radiocarbon yielding significantly different chronologies. While this could point to the incorporation of younger pollen into the profile along seasonal dry cracks, older humins may also move up in the profile due to vertical mixing. Additional, spatially highly resolved measurements of the bulk OSL signal (Ln and Ln/Tn) combined with data on down-core variation in K, Th, and U concentration, grain size and moisture content were used to (i) guide the development of an age-depth relationship (i.e. age model) for the entire core based on three different data input scenarios, and (ii) test the applicability of novel luminescence screening techniques in seasonal swamp settings. Results suggest only minor differences among the applied models and scenarios, providing an overall reliable representation of the depositional history in the swamp. Even though all resulting age-depth models have relatively large uncertainties in the lower part of the core, there are significant changes in sedimentation rate over time, providing a chronological basis for a more detailed palaeoenvironmental analysis at TTS. The approach used may also be useful in developing age models in other complex environments, and has shown the importance of understanding carbon pathways as well as controls on luminescence signals when developing age models.},

  abstract = {Several recent studies have successfully applied diatom-based paleolimnological techniques to infer past hydrological changes in arctic and subarctic regions. For example, we summarize arctic studies that attempt to determine changes in peat water content, flood frequency, river discharge, effective moisture and ice cover in northern regions. Some of the investigations are still in preliminary stages, but represent innovative approaches to study arctic and subarctic paleohydrology. New data demonstrate that lake depth, which may be related to changing hydrological conditions, is a significant variable influencing the distributions of diatom taxa in lake surface sediment calibration sets from Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP), on the border of Alberta and the Northwest Territories, Canada, and from Fennoscandia (mainly northwest Finland). Weighted averaging regression and calibration methods were used to develop quantitative inference models for lake depth using diatom assemblages preserved in surface sediments. The predictive abilities of the transfer functions were relatively high (for WBNP r2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 2.6 m, and for Fennoscandia r2 = 0.88 and RMSE = 1.8 m). However, evaluating the transfer functions using jack-knifing procedures indicated lower predictive abilities, possibly reflecting the relatively small sample size and/or short gradients used in these calibration sets. Such transfer functions can be used to track overall trends in lake levels, and provide an objective assessment as to directions of changing lake levels. Any interpretations of inferred lake levels, especially those related to climate change, must be made cautiously and must include some understanding of the local, present-day hydrological system.},

  abstract = {A late Quaternary marine palynological record from the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) site 820, adjacent to the humid tropics region of northeastern Australia, has demonstrated marked variation in orbital scale cyclicity, and also trends associated with both climate and human impact. However, some uncertainties in interpretation have resulted from concerns about the records chronology and continuity. Here we present, for the first time, the complete palynological data from detailed analysis of the top 67~m of sediment and examine it in relation to the marine isotope sequence from the core. It is proposed that the record is relatively continuous through the last 250,000~years although the latter part of oxygen isotope stage (OIS) 5, as well OIS 4 may be missing. Despite the variation on orbital scales, most palynological changes are not in phase with those from the marine isotope record suggesting a lack of direct Milankovitch forcing on vegetation. This lack of correspondence combined with major trends towards more open and sclerophyllous vegetation in association with increased burning supports a previous proposal that major control is being exercised by El Niño-Southern Oscillation variability whose influence may have been initiated by changes in oceanic circulation in the region within the mid Pleistocene. The lack of impact on the distribution of complex rainforest suggests that increased climate variability did not involve an overall decrease in total precipitation.},

  abstract = {Unarguably, one of the most significant paleoclimatological discoveries of the last two decades has been that of abrupt climate events (Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles and Heinrich events). Most evidence for these events has originated from the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere, with few records documenting the response of the low latitude Southern Hemisphere. Here we present new data from Lynch's Crater, a unique terrestrial record from NE-Australia that may show evidence for southward propagations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during abrupt climate perturbations as a result of alteration of the low latitude air masses. Proxies for precipitation/wetness indicate enhanced rainfall in the region during Heinrich events (H events 1–3) and the 8.2ka Northern Hemisphere cold event. A fully coupled atmosphere/ocean climate model simulating a 1 Sv freshwater influx to the North Atlantic Ocean produces a scenario which agrees with the climate changes shown by the Lynch's Crater record. The model shows precipitation anomalies that include a southward migration of the ITCZ and a zonal shift in mid-latitude storm tracks over the Southern Hemisphere equatorial region. These data indicate large-scale shifts of the austral summer ITCZ position that is known to control monsoonal precipitation in NE Australia. This terrestrial record from Australia may demonstrate the involvement of the tropical western Pacific Ocean in ITCZ migrations during abrupt climate events of the last glacial period. Defining such past migrations offers insight into the importance and role of the equatorial region in global climate dynamics.},

This study extends U/Th dating by applying it not only to calcretes, but also to Fe/Mn oxyhydroxide/oxide accumulations. While a direct correlation cannot be made between U/Th dates from secondary minerals and TL dates from the host sediments, both sets of data show broad consistency. In addition to providing a minima for acceptable TL ages, U/Th dates are useful for determining the chronology of pedogenesis/diagenesis. They show that calcretes and ferricretes have formed under similar climatic conditions in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia during the late pleistocene. Beneath about 5–12 m the Gilbert fan delta consists of an extensive sand body older than 85,000 yr and probably about 120,000 yr in age, representative of a period of major fluvial activity not repeated since this time. Above are muds and fine sandy muds that extend uninterrupted to the present surface except in the downstream fan where they are bisected by a thin unit of medium sand that TL dates at 40,000–50,000 yr B.P. A system of sandy distributary channels over the fan surface represents an early Holocene fluvial phase probably more active than at present.},

  abstract = {Contemporary benthic diatom assemblages were examined from 52 riverine and palustrine wetlands on Cape York Peninsula, Australia, to determine their environmental sensitivities and develop inference models. Multivariate analyses identified strong relationships between nine environmental variables and the diatom assemblage composition, with the aim to select variables for developing models. Total alkalinity, bicarbonate concentration, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and latitude were most consistently and strongly correlated with diatom composition. The river basins sampled generally have an east–west orientation, so latitude potentially represents biogeographic differences between basins. Comparison of diatom assemblages between river basins showed significant differences, but substantial overlap in species. Diatom-based transfer functions were developed for each environmental variable and tested using the relationships between measured values and values predicted by the transfer functions. These were significant, and had low root mean square errors. An independent validation dataset for EC was analysed and applied to the EC transfer function. Results showed good predictions, giving confidence in its relevance beyond the training dataset. These understandings and models of the environmental effects on diatom assemblages allow for their application to future monitoring programs and reconstruction of past water quality conditions using fossilised diatoms in layered aquatic sediments of Cape York.},

  abstract = {Growing climate proxy evidence suggests that changes in sea level are important drivers of tropical climate change on glacial-interglacial timescales. These paleodata suggest that rainfall patterns over the Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) are highly sensitive to the landmass configuration of the Maritime Continent and that lowered sea level contributed to large-scale drying during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, approximately 21,000 years B.P.). Using the Community Earth System Model Version 1.2 (CESM1), we investigate the mechanisms by which lowered sea level influenced the climate of the IPWP during the LGM. The CESM1 simulations show that, in agreement with previous hypotheses, changes in atmospheric circulation are initiated by the exposure of the Sunda and Sahul shelves. Ocean dynamical processes amplify the changes in atmospheric circulation by increasing the east-west sea surface temperature (SST) gradient along the equatorial Indian Ocean. The coupled mechanism driving this response is akin to the Bjerknes feedback and results in a large-scale climatic reorganization over the Indian Ocean with impacts extending from east Africa to the western tropical Pacific. Unlike exposure of the Sunda shelf, exposure of Sahul shelf and the associated changes in surface albedo play a key role because of the positive feedback. This mechanism could explain the pattern of dry (wet) eastern (western) Indian Ocean identified in climate proxies and LGM simulations. However, this response also requires a strengthened SST gradient along the equatorial Indian Ocean, a pattern that is not evident in marine paleoreconstructions. Strategies to resolve this issue are discussed.},

  abstract = {Pyrogenic carbon (charcoal, black carbon, elemental carbon) is one of the most common materials used for radiocarbon dating of terrestrial samples. However, exogenous carbon contamination can compromise the accuracy of radiocarbon ages. This study presents the results of two chemical pretreatments prior to hydrogen pyrolysis (hypy) as improved protocols for the isolation and decontamination of pyrogenic carbon, i) a simple acid-oxidation step (A-Ox/hypy) and ii) acid-base-acid (ABA/hypy). The A-Ox/hypy protocol uses HNO3 and H2O2, while ABA/hypy uses HCl and NaOH. Both pretreatments remove labile and inorganic carbon before hypy, decreasing the potential for in situ production of pyrogenic carbon during the hypy reaction. The effectiveness of each protocol was directly measured on charcoal artificially produced at 350 °C, 450 °C and 550 °C from radiocarbon-free wood, and exposed to environmental contamination for 1–3 yrs. The results show a {$>$}94\% reduction in carbon contamination for the 450 °C and 550 °C charcoal samples occurred using A-Ox/hypy, but this treatment was less effective for the 350 °C charcoal. A {$>$}99\% reduction in carbon contamination in all charcoal samples examined occurred using ABA/hypy. The A-Ox/hypy protocol was further tested on cave guano sediments, which had previously reported erroneous dates following simple organic solvent extraction followed by ABA pretreatment. Effective decontamination was achieved using A-Ox/hypy on the guano, which corrected a radiocarbon age reversal. Overall, ABA/hypy effectively decontaminated the charcoals and was a more efficient pretreatment for charcoal than A-Ox/hypy, however resulting in larger sample mass loss. Therefore, ABA/hypy is the recommended protocol for older ({$>$}30,000 14C yr BP) charcoal or sediment samples, or where date accuracy is imperative, while A-Ox/hypy represents an improved protocol for the quick and cost-effective measurement of younger samples ({$<$}30,000 14C yr BP) when sample size is of concern.},

This paper presents (super 14) C dating of soil organic matter (SOM), humin fraction, and charcoal in several soil profiles under natural vegetation from different Brazil locations (north, central, and southeast regions). The main objective is to compare the obtained (super 14) C dating of total SOM with humin, the oldest fraction of SOM. In order to validate the humin ages these data are compared with the age of charcoal collected at similar depths. The (super 14) C ages obtained on charcoal were, in most of the cases, in agreement with the humin fraction considering the experimental errors, or 20\% older in average. The dates obtained from total SOM showed significantly younger ages than the humin fraction indicating contamination by younger carbon. These results show the humin fraction is considered a reliable material for (super 14) C dating in soils. However, the humin fraction ages could be assumed as the minimum ages for carbon in soils.},

However, the long-term impacts of drier climatic conditions on tropical dry forests are not well understood, despite climate models predicting increased droughts over Bolivia in the coming century. In this paper, we assess the impacts of drier climatic conditions during the mid-Holocene on the Bolivian Chiquitano tropical dry forest using fossilised pollen, phytoliths, macro-charcoal, and geochemical proxies from a sediment core from a large lake (Laguna Mandioré) on the Bolivia–Brazil border. Our results show that drier climatic conditions during the mid-Holocene caused a local-scale, ecotonal expansion of upland savannah at the expense of dry forest. Interaction between drier climatic conditions and fire regime likely exerted a stronger control over the position of the dry forest–savannah ecotone than edaphic factors. However, the majority of the dry forest within the lake catchment maintained a closed canopy throughout the drier conditions of the mid-Holocene, despite floristic turnover towards more drought-tolerant taxa. These findings imply overall resilience of the Chiquitano dry forest biome to future drought, albeit with floristic changes and upland savannah encroachment at ecotones.},

  abstract = {Phytolith analysis is conventionally an archeo-botanical tool used to study past human activity using material from excavations or soil pits. However, phytolith analysis also has potential as a paleoecological tool, to reconstruct vegetation changes through periods of climatic change and human influence. To study phytoliths from lake sediment alongside pollen requires an understanding of phytolith taphonomy in lakes. Theoretical models suggest phytoliths represent more local vegetation at smaller spatial scales than pollen from lake sediments, but this has not been tested empirically in the Neotropics. This paper compares pollen and phytolith assemblages from the same lake sediment surface sample, from a suite of lakes of different sizes across different vegetation types of lowland tropical Bolivia. We find three factors driving phytolith composition in lakes: taphonomy, lake size and phytolith productivity. By comparing phytolith assemblages with pollen assemblages, we find that they provide different taxonomic information and generally complement each other as paleo-vegetation proxies. We also demonstrate empirically that pollen assemblages in lake samples represent a larger catchment area than phytolith assemblages. Our findings suggest that phytoliths can be particularly useful in providing local-scale vegetation histories from large lakes, to complement the regional-scale vegetation histories provided by pollen data.},

  abstract = {To better understand the response of tropical wetlands to Holocene environmental changes, two lacustrine diatom records from Weipa, Cape York, have been investigated. The record from Big Willum (BW01) commenced approx. 7.9 calibrated thousand years before present (k cal a BP) and details stages of initial swamp development, a phase of ephemeral conditions between approximately 5.7 and 2.2 k~cal a BP and relative wetland stability after 2.2 k~cal a BP. Lithological and to a lesser extent diatom assemblage changes in BW01 appear to be linked to broad-scale changes in effective precipitation. The record from Little Willum (LW01) commenced around 0.9 k~cal a BP and documents initial phases of swamp development until approximately 0.8 k~cal a BP with subsequent relative wetland stability. The uppermost 10~cm of this record, approximately spanning the last 40 years, coincide with mining activity in the region. Only minor changes in the diatom assemblage are recorded for this period implying that the overall character of the swamp probably remained unchanged. Both sites offer new insights into wetland dynamics in Australia's dry tropics and demonstrate that changes in these lacustrine systems were probably driven by shifts in effective precipitation, in particular during the late Holocene.},

  abstract = {Analysis of the stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) in organic material in various geological archives has been widely used for paleoclimatic reconstruction. Consequently, it is important to characterize the δ13C values of modern plants and surface soils to provide analogues for strengthening paleoclimatic reconstructions. In this paper, {$>$}10.000 previously reported δ13C values from modern plants and surface soils at globally distributed sites, together with newly obtained surface soil δ13C data from 107 sites in inland China, are used to establish relationships with corresponding mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation amount (MAP). Using a δ13C value of −24‰ of surface soil as the discriminator between pure C3 vegetation and C3/C4 mixed vegetation, our results demonstrate a close relationship between MAT and C4 relative abundance, implying that temperature is the primary climatic factor determining the C3/C4 relative abundance. Both the δ13C values of modern C3 plants and surface soils under pure C3 vegetation are significantly negatively correlated with MAP, confirming that the δ13C of material sourced from pure C3 vegetation can be used for paleoprecipitation reconstruction. However, unlike C3 plants, the δ13C values of modern C4 plants are significantly positively correlated with MAP. Thus our results can serve as a reference for the paleoclimatic interpretation of sedimentary δ13C data.},

  abstract = {Phytoliths are silica casts of plant cells, created within and between living tissues across almost all plant clades. Because they are abundant, durable and distinctive, phytoliths are used to deduce historic vegetation patterns and human uses across the fields of archeology, paleoethnobotany, paleoecology, and historical ecology, particularly at sites where preservation of larger plant-derived samples is poor. Nonetheless, phytolith research has recently contributed to advances in biogeochemical cycling and carbon sequestration. Although much progress has been made over the past few decades, some basic methodological concerns in phytolith systematics and Si cycling still hamper the overall development of this emerging field of science. Here, we first review basic scenarios of phytolith studies across different disciplines of science and then advocate interdisciplinary phytolith research to overcome the challenges of phytolith systematics, inform the representation of Si and C cycling in biogeochemical models, and improve the utility of phytoliths as proxies in archeology and paleontology.},

  abstract = {An environmental history is presented from Girraween Lagoon, Darwin region of the Northern Territory, Australia. Pollen and charcoal analysis of a 5-meter sediment core provides a record of vegetation change, fire history and climate spanning 12,700 cal BP to the present day. This study focusses on tree-grass vegetation dynamics, eucalypt to non-eucalypt plant interactions, and climate–fire–human relationships in an area where few long-term savanna records exist.

  abstract = {We assess a replicated fire plot experiment undertaken between 1973 and 1996 in two Eucalyptus-dominated savanna vegetation formations (open forest, woodland), at Munmarlary, in monsoonal northern Australia. Four treatments, each with three replicates, were imposed on each vegetation type: annual early dry-season burning; annual late dry-season burning; biennial early dry-season burning; and unburned controls. Treatments were imposed faithfully, with noted exceptions, on 1-ha plots. Fire intensities were typically low ({$<$}1000 kW/m) to moderate (1000?2500 kW/m), varied significantly between treatments, and generally were greater in woodland. In both woodland and open forest, pH was significantly lower and NO3-N was significantly higher in unburned plots. Organic C was not significantly greater in unburned treatments. Effects of fire regime on other soil chemical properties differed between open forest and woodland sites. Among the grasses, invariant frequent burning led to the dominance of a small number of annual species, notably regionally dominant Sorghum. In the absence of burning, annuals declined generally, whereas some perennials increased while most decreased. These responses usually were apparent within the first five years of the experiment. At the relatively small spatial scale of the grass sampling regime, there was high turnover of both annual and perennial grasses. Under low- to moderate-intensity, frequent burning regimes, woody vegetation dominated by mature eucalypts is structurally stable. In the absence of burning for at least five years, there was release of the non-eucalypt, woody component into the midstory; this occurred more rapidly in open forest. Accession of rain forest species occurred on some woodland plots, especially the unburned treatment. In contrast, eucalypts were not released significantly from the understory. Rather, as suggested by other studies, recruitment of eucalypts into the canopy appears to involve significantly reduced root competition through death of dominant eucalypts. Although the Munmarlary experiment provides invaluable quantitative data for exploring relationships between fire regimes and the responses of north Australian savanna systems, it has been less successful in meeting the complex information requirements of regional fire managers. Replicated experimental fire plot designs, no matter how elegant and rigorously implemented, may substantially fail the test of management relevance, given the fundamental requirement for savanna biodiversity managers to experience the integrated effects of fire regimes that vary idiosyncratically over multiple time and spatial scales. We suggest that such information requirements are better met through modest, targeted ?adaptive management? studies, involving collaborative partnerships between managers and researchers.

Using a three-tiered fire severity scale, data for 719 fires recorded from 178 plots over the period 1995–2004 indicate that the great majority of early dry season (pre-August) fires were of very low severity (fire-line intensities {$<<$}1000 kW m–1), whereas fires later in the dry season were typically of substantially greater severity. Similar trends were evident for vegetation occupying all landform types.

  abstract = {Understanding the main factors driving fire regimes in grasslands and savannas is critical to better manage their biodiversity and functions. Moreover, improving our knowledge on pyrogenic carbon (PyC) dynamics, including formation, transport and deposition, is fundamental to better understand a significant slow-cycling component of the global carbon cycle, particularly as these ecosystems account for a substantial proportion of the area globally burnt. However, a thorough assessment of past fire regimes in grass-dominated ecosystems is problematic due to challenges in interpreting the charcoal record of sediments. It is therefore critical to adopt appropriate sampling and analytical methods to allow the acquisition of reliable data and information on savanna fire dynamics. This study uses hydrogen pyrolysis (HyPy) to quantify PyC abundance and stable isotope composition (δ13C) in recent sediments across 38 micro-catchments covering a wide range of mixed C3/C4 vegetation in north Queensland, Australia. We exploited the contrasting δ13C values of grasses (i.e. C4; δ13C {$>$}-15‰) and woody vegetation (i.e. C3; δ13C {$<$}-24‰) to assess the preferential production and transport of grass-derived PyC in savanna ecosystems. Analyses were conducted on bulk and size-fractionated samples to determine the fractions into which PyC preferentially accumulates. Our data show that the δ13C value of PyC in the sediments is decoupled from the δ13C value of total organic carbon, which suggests that a significant component of PyC may be derived from incomplete grass combustion, even when the proportion of C4 grass biomass in the catchment was relatively small. Furthermore, we conducted 16 experimental burns that indicate that there is a comminution of PyC produced in-situ to smaller particles, which facilitates the transport of this material, potentially affecting its preservation potential. Savanna fires preferentially burn the grass understory rather than large trees, leading to a bias toward the finer C4–derived PyC in the sedimentary record. This in turn, provides further evidence for the preferential production and transport of C4-derived PyC in mixed ecosystems where grass and woody vegetation coexist. Moreover, our isotopic approach provides independent validation of findings derived from conventional charcoal counting techniques concerning the appropriateness of adopting a relatively small particle size threshold.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Widespread burning of mixed tree–grass ecosystems represents the major natural locus of pyrogenic carbon (PyC) production. PyC is a significant, pervasive and yet poorly understood "slow-cycling" form of carbon present in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, soils and sediments. We conducted 16 experimental burns on a rainfall transect through northern Australian savannas with C\textsubscript{4} grasses ranging from 35 to 99\% of total biomass. Residues from each fire were partitioned into PyC and further into recalcitrant (HyPyC) components, with each of these fluxes also partitioned into proximal components ({$>$}125 μm), likely to remain close to the site of burning, and distal components (\&lt;125 μm), likely to be transported from the site of burning. The median (range) PyC production across all burns was 16.0 (11.5) \% of total carbon exposed (TCE), with HyPyC accounting for 2.5 (4.9) \% of TCE. Both PyC and HyPyC were dominantly partitioned into the proximal flux. Production of HyPyC was strongly related to fire residence time, with shorter duration fires resulting in higher HyPyC yields. The carbon isotope (δ\textsuperscript{13}C) compositions of PyC and HyPyC were generally lower by 1–3\&permil; relative to the original biomass, with marked depletion up to 7\&permil; for grasslands dominated by C\textsubscript{4} biomass. δ\textsuperscript{13}C values of CO\textsubscript{2} produced by combustion were computed by mass balance and ranged from \textasciitilde 0.4 to 1.3\&permil;. The depletion of \textsuperscript{13}C in PyC and HyPyC relative to the original biomass has significant implications for the interpretation of δ\textsuperscript{13}C values of savanna soil organic carbon and of ancient PyC preserved in the geologic record, as well as for global \textsuperscript{13}C isotopic disequilibria calculations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Our classification scheme emphasizes the macroscopic structure and microscopic components of the sedimentary matrix (clastic, chemical and biological) and can be applied to a wide range of lacustrine settings. Such a classification scheme is necessary to i) facilitate communication and collaboration between the highly interdisciplinary community of scientists that study lacustrine archives, ii) create a structure for comparative lacustrine sedimentological studies, and iii) take greater advantage of the great potential information recorded by changing depositional environments. Such a development is needed in light of current and planned Global Lake Drilling efforts and to expedite the creation of on-line, searchable databases of global lacustrine archives.

Average specific leaf area (SLA, m2 kg-1) of leaves ranged from 10.7 ± 1.7 (av. ± s.d.) in N2 fixing deciduous trees to 0.8 ± 0.4 in spinescent sclerophylls shrubs. SLA generally decreased with increasing aridity. N2 fixing species had higher leaf N concentration (average N-concentration 20.1 ± 3.7 mgN g-1) than non- N2 fixing (10.8 ± 3.3) or spinescent species (7.05 ± 1.8). Community-averaged Δ was approximately constant at rainfalls above 475 mm (average Δ = 19.4 ± 1.2‰). Where rainfall was less than 475 mm, Δ decreased from 19‰  to 17‰ at 220 mm. Δ was positively correlated with SLA. Δ of deciduous N2 fixing species and spinescent species were 1‰ and 2.4‰  lower than in evergreen sclerophyllous species. Δ in the N2 fixing Allocasuarina was 1.2‰ lower than in non- N2 fixing sclerophyllous species. The δ15N-values indicated N2 fixation only at high rainfall. Burning of the field layer in a Eucalyptus forest had no effect on all measured tree parameters including δ15N, but δ15N increased under grazing conditions to {$>$}5‰. The constant value of community averaged Δ between 1800 and 450 mm may be the result of replacement of functional types and species. The decline in Δ in the more arid section may be a function of both low species diversity, and a highly aseasonal and unpredictable rainfall regime.},

  abstract = {Carbon isotope natural abundance (δ13C) has been previously used as a powerful tool in the study of water-using processes at the leaf, individual and within-community levels. We analysed 348 species from 12 plant communities along a 900 km-long rainfall gradient in southern Queensland. Although the range of δ13C values found in a given community was large, variability in the δ13C signature of plants within a community was relatively small given the large numbers of species sampled (mean n per site of 29) and the taxonomic diversity in each. The community-averaged δ13C signature ranged from -25.60 in a brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) dominated community in western Queensland to - 31.20 in subtropical rainforest in eastern Queensland. A strong relationship was found between the δ13C value averaged for each site and rainfall within the range 350-1700 mm per annum. Foliar δ13C was also related to the number of rain days per annum and moisture balance (rainfall - evaporation). The strength of these relationships varied only slightly according to the rainfall parameter used, with values for r2 of 0.78, 0.70, 0.70 and 0.74 for the relationship between δ13C and long-term rainfall average, 5-year rainfall average, number of rain days and moisture balance, respectively. Despite considerable taxonomic variability within a given plant community, the averaged δ13C signature for that community gives a strong indication of moisture availability.},

  abstract = {Phytoliths, microscopic plant silica bodies, are often preserved in modern and fossil soils and sediment, as well as in archaeological contexts. They record unique characteristics of past vegetation and, unlike palynomorphs and macrofossils, are commonly found in direct association with fossil vertebrates, providing vital paleoecological data. Within pre-Quaternary paleoecology, phytolith analysis has so far elucidated Cretaceous-Cenozoic grass evolution, vegetation change including the spread of grasslands, plant-animal co-evolution, and diets of extinct animals. Because deep-time phytolith analysis is a young field, many methodological aspects are not standardized, preventing comparisons among studies and calibration using published modern analogs. On the other hand, the plethora of novel approaches in recent literature points to the potential of phytolith-based paleoecology. Here, we review the present state of phytolith analysis, focusing on pre-Quaternary applications. We discuss the nature and known biases of the phytolith record, current methods, and examples of when phytoliths contributed substantially to knowledge of past ecosystems, and highlight important future avenues of research.},

  abstract = {Phytoliths, unlike pollen and charcoal, are frequently conserved in sediments in the Maya lowlands but are rarely used as paleoenvironmental proxies. To better interpret and reconstruct paleoecological signatures and changes, it is necessary to provide current analog of fossil assemblages. To do so, we selected six modern ecosystems and differentiated them by their soil phytolith assemblages in the ancient Maya city of Naachtun (northern Petén, Guatemala). We studied the plant communities and relative phytoliths frequencies in surface soils on 4 north–south vegetation transect, composed of 43 quadrats. These transects cross forests and savannahs in low swampy areas North and South of the site, and hill forest in its center, where the city was built. Quadrats were statistically compared using multivariate analyses (CA). Six types of plant communities were characterized by their phytolith assemblages, as well as on the presence of siliceous bioindicators such as diatoms and sponges. The D/P and LU indexes developed for these assemblages allow us to provide a precise signature of the current vegetation cover, and identify the presence of undergrowth in forest areas, or forest edges in savannah areas. This first modern phytolith reference for the Maya area will contribute to the development of paleoecological reconstructions for this zone.},

  abstract = {The Gulf of Carpentaria is a shallow epicontinental sea between Australia and Papua New Guinea (Fig. 1); it has a maximum depth of −69 m and is connected to the Arafura Sea across a −53-m sill1; in the east, the connection to the Coral Sea through Torres Straits is −12 m (ref. 1). We propose here that low sea levels during the Pleistocene2,3 (Fig. 2) resulted in subaerial exposure of the Gulf of Carpentaria, thereby reducing the regional input of moisture and latent heat to the atmosphere and tropical cyclogenesis. As a result, the climate of the Carpentaria Basin may have been significantly drier than at present4,5. Even so, previous workers6,7 have reported the presence of lacustrine sediments in the Gulf that could have been deposited when the sea level dropped below the −53-m contour1. During 1982, the extent of Lake Carpentaria was defined by high-resolution seismic profiles and cores. The size and development of Lake Carpentaria and its dependence on the hydrological balance are discussed below.},

  abstract = {The construction of accurate age–depth relationships and a realistic assessment of their uncertainties is one of the fundamental prerequisites for comparing and correlating late Quaternary stratigraphical proxy records. Four widely used age–depth modelling routines – CLAM, OxCal, Bacon and Bchron – were tested using radiocarbon dates simulated from varved sediment stratigraphies. All methods produce mean age–depth models that are close to the true varve age, but the uncertainty estimation differs considerably among models. Age uncertainties are usually underestimated by CLAM, whereas age uncertainties produced by Bchron are often too large. With OxCal and Bacon, the setting of model-specific parameters influences the estimated uncertainties, which vary from too large to too small. The variability of sediment accumulation rates is underestimated by CLAM but overestimated by Bacon and Bchron. Bayesian age–depth models mainly improve the assessment of uncertainties of age–depth models.},

Here we present one reconstruction of environmental change for the tropics. This reconstruction covers the past 50 ka using a suite of geochemical data from the high-resolution sequence of Lynch's Crater in northeast Queensland, Australia, a region highly sensitive to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity. The 23 major oxides and trace elements measured could be summarised by extracting three axes using principal components analysis (accounting for 72\% of the variability). The data indicate that the greatest variability in the geochemical data accounted for erosional activity within the catchment that was associated with past changes in the frequency of ENSO activity (though this was less sensitive during wetter periods, probably as a result of buffering by high vegetation cover). The remaining variability was largely explained by elements that form complexes with organic compounds (e.g., humic acids) and those that are important nutrients for specific vegetation types (and therefore a measure of vegetation distribution). For more detailed reconstructions, further work is required to disentangle the complex controls of elements within sedimentary sequences.},

ENSO variability has been suggested to be linked to millennial-scale oscillations in North Atlantic climate during that time2,3, but the proposals disagree on whether increased frequency of El Niño events, the warm phase of ENSO, was linked to North Atlantic warm or cold periods. Here we present a high-resolution record of surface moisture, based on the degree of peat humification and the ratio of sedges to grass, from northern Queensland, Australia, covering the past 45,000 yr. We observe millennial-scale dry periods, indicating periods of frequent El Niño events (summer precipitation declines in El Niño years in northeastern Australia). We find that these dry periods are correlated to the Dansgaard–Oeschger events—millennial-scale warm events in the North Atlantic climate record—although no direct atmospheric connection from the North Atlantic to our site can be invoked. Additionally, we find climatic cycles at a semiprecessional timescale (∼11,900 yr). We suggest that climate variations in the tropical Pacific Ocean on millennial as well as orbital timescales, which determined precipitation in northeastern Australia, also exerted an influence on North Atlantic climate through atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections.},

This is the second synthesis of the PAGES GM Working Group following the first synthesis “The Global Monsoon across Time Scales: coherent variability of regional monsoons” published in 2014 (Climate of the Past, 10, 2007–2052). Here we introduce the GM as a planetary scale circulation system and give a brief accounting of why it exhibits regional structure. The primary driver of the GM is solar insolation, and the specific features in the underlying surface, such as land-sea distribution, topography, and oceanic circulations, are mainly responsible for the differences among regional monsoon systems. We then analyze the monsoon formation mechanisms, together with the major processes that drive monsoon variations at various timescales, including external forcings and internal feedbacks. On long time scales, external forcings often induce variability on a global scale, whereas short-term variability in regional monsoon systems is usually caused by internal feedbacks within the climate system. Finally, a number of debatable issues are discussed, with an emphasis on time scales beyond the instrumental record. These include the dual nature of the monsoon as wind and rain, the meaning of oxygen isotope in hydrological cycle, in particular of speleothem δ18O, the role of ice-sheet in monsoon variations, etc. In general, the GM as a system comprises a hierarchy of regional and local monsoons with various degrees of similarity, though all show coherent variability driven by a common solar forcing. The goal of the GM concept, therefore, is by no means to replace or diminish research on the regional monsoons, but to help dissect the mechanisms and controlling factors of monsoon variability at various temporal-spatial scales.},

Measured14C ages of soil organic matter or its fractions are always younger than the true ages of soils due to continuous input of organic matter into soils. Differences in soil C dynamics due to climate or soil depth will result in significantly different14C signatures of soil organic matter for soils of the same age. As a result, the deviation of the measured14C age from the true age of soil formation could differ significantly among different soils or soil horizons. Our model calculations also suggest that14C ages of soil organic matter will eventually reach a steady state provided that no climatic or ecological perturbations occur. Once a soil or a soil horizon has reached a steady state,14C dating of soil organic matter will provide no useful information regarding the age of the soil. However, for soils in which steady state has not been reached, it is possible to estimate the age of soil formation by modeling the measured14C contents of soil organic matter. Radiocarbon dating of buried soils could, in general, overestimate the true age of the burial by as much as the steady-state age of the soil or soil horizon.},

But long, accurately dated records of southern tropical palaeoclimate, which would allow the establishment of climatic connections to distant regions, have not been available. Here we present a 210,000-year (210-kyr) record of wet periods in tropical northeastern Brazil—a region that is currently semi-arid. The record is obtained from speleothems and travertine deposits that are accurately dated using the U/Th method. We find wet periods that are synchronous with periods of weak East Asian summer monsoons2, cold periods in Greenland3, Heinrich events in the North Atlantic4 and periods of decreased river runoff to the Cariaco basin5. We infer that the wet periods may be explained with a southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This widespread synchroneity of climate anomalies suggests a relatively rapid global reorganization of the ocean–atmosphere system. We conclude that the wet periods probably affected rainforest distribution, as plant fossils show that forest expansion occurred during these intermittent wet intervals, and opened a forest corridor6,7,8 between the Amazonian and Atlantic rainforests.},

The surface of the sand body reveals a series of small reversing dunes formed by north to westerly winds, and south to southeasterly winds. The thermoluminescence chronology of the climbing dune indicates aeolian activity for the Last Glacial Maximum (ca 22 ka) and the mid‐ to late Holocene (ca 6 ka to the present). Adjacent alluvium provides evidence for fluvial activity at ca 37 ka (Subpluvial Stage 3) and a return to fluvial activity in the early to mid‐Holocene (ca 12–5 ka). These observations conform well with other findings in northern Australia, but a dry late Holocene is in contrast to results from further south in the Great Sandy Desert.},

  abstract = {Climate change could potentially interrupt progress toward a world without hunger. A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a “climate-smart food system” that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.},

  abstract = {Abstract The AMS 14C technique has the advantage that small samples of Late Quaternary age can be dated with high accuracy, and that errors due to reservoir effects can be avoided if specifically determined terrestrial micro- and macrofossils are measured. However, to obtain such high-accuracy measurements, it is important how small samples are handled prior to treatment in the radiocarbon laboratories. Here we present a set of 51 AMS 14C measurements, of which 31 dates gave expected ages and 20 dates resulted in anomalously young ages, despite the fact that all samples consisted of clearly identified Late Weichselian terrestrial plant macrofossils. To evaluate possible sources of error, we compared these samples in respect to preparation methods, sample storage and sample weight. Our results show that the long-term storage of wet macrofossil samples appears to have a significant effect on the radiocarbon age obtained, even when the samples are kept cool. Fungi or micro-organisms may easily be incorporated into a sample during preparation and identification, and can easily contribute to the contamination of a sample, if stored cool and wet for several months. ? 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {During the laboratory pretreatment of samples for radiocarbon dating, small amounts of carbon may be added to a sample. Contamination can be incorporated at any stage: during chemical pretreatment, combustion to CO2, graphitization, or accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement. Such carbon contamination is often modern in age, and so can have an especially severe effect on samples older than \textasciitilde 25 ka BP. During the extraction of collagen from bone using the ultrafiltration protocol at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU), small amounts of young carbon are added to the sample. Currently, this contamination is poorly characterized when less than 10 mg of collagen is extracted from a bone. Demand to date small collagen samples with 14C concentrations that approach the detection limit of AMS measurement has increased recently with the growing interest in, for example, directly dating Neanderthal remains and Upper Paleolithic bone artifacts. This paper aims to reduce the minimum collagen sample size required to produce a reliable date from 10 to 5 mg by re-examining the combustion background and subsequently the pretreatment background for bone. The average of 136 measurements of directly combusted nylon suggests that 0.0007 ± 0.001 mg of modern carbon is added to each sample, although the distribution is positively skewed. Regression analysis of the measurements of 52 collagen samples extracted from a bone of background age results in a background of just less than 50,000 BP for bone treated at ORAU.}

  abstract = {Radiocarbon dates form the basis of many archaeological chronologies that span the last 50,000 years. Since the first studies in the early 1950s the method has changed almost beyond recognition, with the major developments often described as revolutions. Dates are now more likely to be measured in an AMS than a radiation counter. This is allowing ever-smaller samples to be subjected to increasingly robust pretreatment protocols, improving both accuracy and the range of samples that can be directly dated. A terrestrial calibration curve now extends to 50,000 years, allowing more confident calibration throughout the late Pleistocene. Finally, rather than simply dating a single sample, it is becoming increasingly common to combine large numbers of radiocarbon dates to create chronological models designed to test specific hypotheses. Development is continuing along these lines, aiming to expand the types of datable materials and improve accuracy and precision, whilst decreasing sample size and cost. However, the largest and most pressing problem facing the field is appropriate publication of dates. Radiocarbon's long history means a range of methods and approaches exist, but the scant details published alongside the majority of dates means assessment of their quality is impossible, either in terms of association with archaeology or accuracy of the number. Whether this is due to a lack of education, journal guidelines or laboratory reporting, work must focus on improving the situation. If we cannot improve publication, many of the thousands of dates produced every year will be unusable in the future. This would be a terrible waste of what is a valuable resource of increasingly high quality chronological information.},

  abstract = {Equatorial Southeast Asia is a key region for global climate change. Here, the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) is a critical driver of atmospheric convection that plays a dominant role in global atmospheric circulation. However, fluctuating sea-levels during the Pleistocene produced the most drastic land-sea area changes on Earth, with the now-drowned continent of Sundaland being exposed as a contiguous landmass for most of the past 2 million years. How vegetation responded to changes in rainfall that resulted from changing shelf exposure and glacial boundary conditions in Sundaland remains poorly understood. Here we use the stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of bat guano and High Molecular Weight n-alkanes, from Saleh Cave in southern Borneo to demonstrate that open vegetation existed during much the past 40,000\,yrs BP. This location is at the southern equatorial end of a hypothesized ‘savanna corridor’ and the results provide the strongest evidence yet for its existence. The corridor would have operated as a barrier to east-west dispersal of rainforest species, and a conduit for north-south dispersal of savanna species at times of lowered sea level, explaining many modern biogeographic patterns. The Saleh Cave record also exhibits a strong correspondence with insolation and sea surface temperatures of the IPWP, suggesting a strong sensitivity of vegetation to tropical climate change on glacial/interglacial timeframes.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The response of the Australian monsoon to external forcings and related mechanisms during the Last Glacial Maximum~(LGM) are investigated by multi-model experiments in CMIP5–PMIP3. Although the annual mean precipitation over the Australian monsoon region decreases, the annual range, or the monsoonality, is enhanced. The precipitation increases in early austral summer and decreases in austral winter, resulting in the amplified annual range, but the main contribution comes from the decreased precipitation in austral winter. The decreased winter precipitation is primarily caused by weakened upward motion, although reduced water vapor also has a moderate contribution. The weakened upward motion is induced by the enhanced land–sea thermal contrast, which intensifies the divergence over northern Australia. The increased Australian monsoon rainfall in early summer, however, is an integrated result of the positive effect of local dynamic processes (enhanced moisture convergence) and the negative effect of thermodynamics (reduced moisture content). The enhanced moisture convergence is caused by two factors: the strengthened northwest–southeast thermal contrast between the cooler Indochina–western Indonesia and the warmer northeastern Australia, and the east–west sea surface temperature gradients between the warmer western Pacific and cooler eastern Indian Ocean, both due to the alteration of land–sea configuration arising from the sea level drop. The enhanced Australian monsoonality in the LGM is not associated with global-scale circulation change such as the shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone; rather, it is mainly due to the change of regional circulations around Australia arising from the changes in land–sea contrast and the east–west SST gradients over the Indian and western Pacific oceans. This finding should be taken into account when investigating its future change under global warming. Our findings may also explain why proxy records indicate different changes in Australian monsoon precipitation during the LGM.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We investigated a late glacial–Holocene lacustrine sediment archive located at 4,050~m a.s.l. in the small carbonate-free catchment of Lake Panch Pokhari, Helambu Himal, Nepal. A δ18O sugar biomarker record was established by applying novel compound-specific δ18O analysis of plant sugar biomarkers (Zech and Glaser in Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom 23:3522–3532, 2009). This method overcomes analytical challenges such as extraction and purification faced by previous methods aimed at using δ18O of aquatic cellulose as a paleoclimate proxy. The δ18O results for sugar biomarkers arabinose, xylose and fucose agree well and reveal a pronounced trend towards lower δ18O values during the deglaciation and the onset of the Bølling/Allerød interstadial. By contrast, the period of the Younger Dryas is characterized by higher δ18O values. The early Holocene again reveals lower δ18O values. We suggest that our lacustrine δ18O record reflects coupled hydrological and thermal control. It is strongly related to changes in the oxygen isotopic composition of paleo-precipitation and resembles the δ18O records of Asian speleothems. With respect to the ‘amount effect,’ the record is interpreted as reflecting the Indian Summer Monsoon intensity. The precipitation signal is, however, amplified in our record by evaporative 18O enrichment that is controlled by the ratio of precipitation to evaporation. We suggest that our δ18O record reflects the variability of the Indian Summer Monsoon, which was strong during the Bølling/Allerød interstadial and early Holocene, but weak during the Younger Dryas stadial. This interpretation is corroborated by a pollen-based index for Lake Panch Pokhari that estimated the strength of the Indian Summer Monsoon versus the strength of the Westerlies. Millennial-scale synchronicity with the Greenland δ18O temperature records highlights the previously suggested strong teleconnections between the Asian Monsoon system and North Atlantic climate variability.},
