  abstract = {Charcoal is the result of natural and anthropogenic burning events, when biomass is exposed to elevated temperatures under conditions of restricted oxygen. This process produces a range of materials, collectively known as pyrogenic carbon, the most inert fraction of which is known as black carbon (BC). BC degrades extremely slowly and is resistant to diagenetic alteration involving the addition of exogenous carbon, making it a useful target substance for radiocarbon dating particularly of more ancient samples, where contamination issues are critical. We present results of tests using a new method for the quantification and isolation of BC, known as hydropyrolysis (hypy). Results show controlled reductive removal of non-BC organic components in charcoal samples, including lignocellulosic and humic material. The process is reproducible and rapid, making hypy a promising new approach not only for isolation of purified BC for 14C measurement but also in quantification of different labile and resistant sample C fractions.},

Although many studies of contamination removal from macroscopic charcoals from tephra sequences have been made, little attention has been paid to those containing no visible charcoal, because of the difficulty of obtaining sufficient carbon for radiometric dating. We report here experiments using accelerator mass spectrometry to establish a reliable method for dating a low-carbon aeolian and peat deposit containing a tephra horizon. Results so far demonstrate that improvements to existing chemical pretreatment methods are possible, and that dates obtained on oxidized fine-grained residues can approach the maximum age determined on good quality chaffed wood samples.},

  abstract = {It is well known that, during the widely used AAA pretreatment (de Vries and Barendsen 1954), alkali treatment is responsible for the incorporation of modern carbon due to the precipitation of atmospheric CO2 as carbonate. Until now, the last step of the experiment, consisting in acid treatment (most of the time with hydrochloric acid) was considered to be sufficient to eliminate all of lab contamination. But wood, peat and sediment present a complex molecular structure. During radiocarbon chemical treatments, functional groups still present in the molecules are likely to form ionic bonds with ``modern'' carbonates. These new chemical bonds resist a ``classical'' acid treatment and are responsible for rejuvenation. This short paper presents preliminary results for two common 14C cases: rejuvenation of a 0.4 pMC wood and of an Oxygen Isotope Stage 3 (OIS3) paleosol. For both cases, contamination due to incorporation of modern carbon during chemical treatment is evaluated and an alternative protocol is proposed.},

  abstract = {Swamps in the seasonal tropics have good potential for the reconstruction of late Quaternary monsoonal dynamics. Their successful use, however, has often been compromised by chronological limitations introduced by a variety of depositional and post-depositional processes actively modifying the swamp deposits. We here present and discuss the results of a multiple dating approach at Table Top Swamp (TTS) in northern Australia (the `Top End'). Single-grain luminescence dating of quartz was successfully used to provide chronology in the lowermost core where insufficient organic material prevents the application of radiocarbon dating. In the uppermost, fine-grained and peaty section of the core, two different organic fractions (pollen concentrate and humins) were dated with AMS radiocarbon yielding significantly different chronologies. While this could point to the incorporation of younger pollen into the profile along seasonal dry cracks, older humins may also move up in the profile due to vertical mixing. Additional, spatially highly resolved measurements of the bulk OSL signal (Ln and Ln/Tn) combined with data on down-core variation in K, Th, and U concentration, grain size and moisture content were used to (i) guide the development of an age-depth relationship (i.e. age model) for the entire core based on three different data input scenarios, and (ii) test the applicability of novel luminescence screening techniques in seasonal swamp settings. Results suggest only minor differences among the applied models and scenarios, providing an overall reliable representation of the depositional history in the swamp. Even though all resulting age-depth models have relatively large uncertainties in the lower part of the core, there are significant changes in sedimentation rate over time, providing a chronological basis for a more detailed palaeoenvironmental analysis at TTS. The approach used may also be useful in developing age models in other complex environments, and has shown the importance of understanding carbon pathways as well as controls on luminescence signals when developing age models.},

  abstract = {During the last decade radiocarbon dating has been used extensively in distinct regions of Brazil to provide information about soil chronology in paleoenvironmental studies. This paper presents (super 14) C dating of soil organic matter (SOM), humin fraction, and charcoal in several soil profiles under natural vegetation from different Brazil locations (north, central, and southeast regions). The main objective is to compare the obtained (super 14) C dating of total SOM with humin, the oldest fraction of SOM. In order to validate the humin ages these data are compared with the age of charcoal collected at similar depths. The (super 14) C ages obtained on charcoal were, in most of the cases, in agreement with the humin fraction considering the experimental errors, or 20\% older in average. The dates obtained from total SOM showed significantly younger ages than the humin fraction indicating contamination by younger carbon. These results show the humin fraction is considered a reliable material for (super 14) C dating in soils. However, the humin fraction ages could be assumed as the minimum ages for carbon in soils.},

Our classification scheme emphasizes the macroscopic structure and microscopic components of the sedimentary matrix (clastic, chemical and biological) and can be applied to a wide range of lacustrine settings. Such a classification scheme is necessary to i) facilitate communication and collaboration between the highly interdisciplinary community of scientists that study lacustrine archives, ii) create a structure for comparative lacustrine sedimentological studies, and iii) take greater advantage of the great potential information recorded by changing depositional environments. Such a development is needed in light of current and planned Global Lake Drilling efforts and to expedite the creation of on-line, searchable databases of global lacustrine archives.

  abstract = {Radiocarbon ages of soil organic matter are evaluated with a model which incorporates the dynamics of the14C content of soil organic matter. Measured14C ages of soil organic matter or its fractions are always younger than the true ages of soils due to continuous input of organic matter into soils. Differences in soil C dynamics due to climate or soil depth will result in significantly different14C signatures of soil organic matter for soils of the same age. As a result, the deviation of the measured14C age from the true age of soil formation could differ significantly among different soils or soil horizons. Our model calculations also suggest that14C ages of soil organic matter will eventually reach a steady state provided that no climatic or ecological perturbations occur. Once a soil or a soil horizon has reached a steady state,14C dating of soil organic matter will provide no useful information regarding the age of the soil. However, for soils in which steady state has not been reached, it is possible to estimate the age of soil formation by modeling the measured14C contents of soil organic matter. Radiocarbon dating of buried soils could, in general, overestimate the true age of the burial by as much as the steady-state age of the soil or soil horizon.},

  abstract = {During the laboratory pretreatment of samples for radiocarbon dating, small amounts of carbon may be added to a sample. Contamination can be incorporated at any stage: during chemical pretreatment, combustion to CO2, graphitization, or accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement. Such carbon contamination is often modern in age, and so can have an especially severe effect on samples older than \textasciitilde{}25 ka BP. During the extraction of collagen from bone using the ultrafiltration protocol at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU), small amounts of young carbon are added to the sample. Currently, this contamination is poorly characterized when less than 10 mg of collagen is extracted from a bone. Demand to date small collagen samples with 14C concentrations that approach the detection limit of AMS measurement has increased recently with the growing interest in, for example, directly dating Neanderthal remains and Upper Paleolithic bone artifacts. This paper aims to reduce the minimum collagen sample size required to produce a reliable date from 10 to 5 mg by re-examining the combustion background and subsequently the pretreatment background for bone. The average of 136 measurements of directly combusted nylon suggests that 0.0007 {$\pm$} 0.001 mg of modern carbon is added to each sample, although the distribution is positively skewed. Regression analysis of the measurements of 52 collagen samples extracted from a bone of background age results in a background of just less than 50,000 BP for bone treated at ORAU.},

  abstract = {Radiocarbon dates form the basis of many archaeological chronologies that span the last 50,000 years. Since the first studies in the early 1950s the method has changed almost beyond recognition, with the major developments often described as revolutions. Dates are now more likely to be measured in an AMS than a radiation counter. This is allowing ever-smaller samples to be subjected to increasingly robust pretreatment protocols, improving both accuracy and the range of samples that can be directly dated. A terrestrial calibration curve now extends to 50,000 years, allowing more confident calibration throughout the late Pleistocene. Finally, rather than simply dating a single sample, it is becoming increasingly common to combine large numbers of radiocarbon dates to create chronological models designed to test specific hypotheses. Development is continuing along these lines, aiming to expand the types of datable materials and improve accuracy and precision, whilst decreasing sample size and cost. However, the largest and most pressing problem facing the field is appropriate publication of dates. Radiocarbon's long history means a range of methods and approaches exist, but the scant details published alongside the majority of dates means assessment of their quality is impossible, either in terms of association with archaeology or accuracy of the number. Whether this is due to a lack of education, journal guidelines or laboratory reporting, work must focus on improving the situation. If we cannot improve publication, many of the thousands of dates produced every year will be unusable in the future. This would be a terrible waste of what is a valuable resource of increasingly high quality chronological information.},
