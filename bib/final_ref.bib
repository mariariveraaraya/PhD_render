  abstract = {Lake-level history for Birch Lake, Alaska, was reconstructed using seismic profiles and multiproxy sedimentary analyses including sedimentology, geochemistry, magnetic susceptibility, and palynology. Twenty-two seismic profiles (18 km total) and eight sediment cores taken from the lake margin to its depocenter at 13.5 m provide evidence for low lake stands during the late Pleistocene and Holocene. Thirty-one AMS radiocarbon dates of macrofossils and pollen provide a century-scale chronology. Prior to 12,700 14C yr B.P., the lake, which now overflows, was either seasonally dry or desiccated for prolonged periods, indicating a severe period of aridity. Lake level rose more than 18 m between 12,700 and 12,200 14C yr B.P. before falling to 17 m below the level of overflow. Between 11,600 and 10,600 14C yr B.P. the water remained between 14 and 17 m below the overflow level. Onlap sedimentary sequences were formed during a transgression phase between 10,600 and 10,000 14C yr B.P. Between 10,000 and about 8800 14C yr B.P. the lake was between 6 and 9 m below the overflow level. Lake level again rose, approaching the overflow level, between 8800 and 8000 14C yr B.P. Seismic and core evidence of minor erosional events suggest lowstands of 2–6 m until 4800 14C yr B.P. There have been no prolonged periods of lake-level depression since that time. The major restructuring of the climate system during deglaciation evidently generated a complex set of fluctuations in effective moisture in interior Alaska, which likely affected eolian processes and vegetation development, as well as lake levels.},

  abstract = {Age-depth modeling using Bayesian statistics requires well-informed prior information about the behavior of sediment accumulation. Here we present average sediment accumulation rates (represented as deposition times, DT, in yr/cm) for lakes in an Arctic setting, and we examine the variability across space (intra- and inter-lake) and time (late Holocene). The dataset includes over 100 radiocarbon dates, primarily on bulk sediment, from 22 sediment cores obtained from 18 lakes spanning the boreal to tundra ecotone gradients in subarctic Canada. There are four to twenty-five radiocarbon dates per core, depending on the length and character of the sediment records. Deposition times were calculated at 100-year intervals from age-depth models constructed using the ‘classical’ age-depth modeling software Clam. Lakes in boreal settings have the most rapid accumulation (mean DT 20~±~10 yr/cm), whereas lakes in tundra settings accumulate at moderate (mean DT 70~±~10 yr/cm) to very slow rates, ({$>$}100~yr/cm). Many of the age-depth models demonstrate fluctuations in accumulation that coincide with lake evolution and post-glacial climate change. Ten of our sediment cores yielded sediments as old as c. 9000~cal BP (BP~=~years before AD 1950). From between c. 9000~cal BP and c. 6000~cal BP, sediment accumulation was relatively rapid (DT of 20–60~yr/cm). Accumulation slowed between c. 5500 and c. 4000~cal BP as vegetation expanded northward in response to warming. A short period of rapid accumulation occurred near 1200~cal BP at three lakes. Our research will help inform priors in Bayesian age modeling.},

  abstract = {Deep-sea core Fr10/95-GC17, collected offshore North West Cape at the western tip of Western Australia, is located beneath the path of the Leeuwin Current. This shallow, warm and low salinity current is an offshoot of the Indonesian Throughflow that transfers water and heat from the West Pacific Ocean into the Indian Ocean. The location is at the edge of the Indo Pacific Warm Pool, the source of large-scale transfer of moisture and heat from the ocean to the atmosphere. For this core, we combine previously published data with new research and use a revised chronology to re-examine the timing of climate change during the last 34,000 years in the tropics of northern Australia. The age model for the core is based on 15 radiocarbon dates complemented by luminescence ages and an oxygen isotope record. This study draws on an extensive range of analyses that have been performed on the core, including micropalaeontology of planktic and benthic foraminifera and coccoliths, stable isotopes analysis of foraminifera and their faunal composition, clay content, sediment composition and pollen analyses. Sea-surface and land temperatures are estimated from the foraminifer faunal analyses and from pollen spectra, respectively. The clay fraction and sediment composition and radiogenic isotopes of that fraction helped identify changes both on land and at sea: changes such as rainfall as shown by river discharge, and oceanic current tracing by neodymium, strontium and lead isotopes obtained from sediments. The most significant finding is that a major threshold was crossed at 13kaBP. Prior to that time, rainfall over NW Western Australia was low as was sea-surface temperature (SST); river discharge to the ocean was also low as a result of the lack of monsoonal activity and finally, ocean alkalinity would have been lower than at present due to the uptake of atmospheric CO2. By 13kaBP, the entire system moved away from glacial period conditions. The Indo-Australian monsoon commenced in and offshore northwestern Western Australia. SST and land temperature increased dramatically and ocean alkalinity changed due to the formation of a “barrier layer” (a low salinity cap), over the Indo Pacific Warm Pool. During the Holocene, river discharge and the land and ocean temperatures did not covary, for example, the highest rainfall did not coincide with the highest SST. Finally, the last 5ka saw a strengthening of ENSO in the region.},

  abstract = {In the Gulf of Carpentaria, northeastern Australia, 30 ka of lacustrine sedimentation provides a record of cyclic deposition of eolian dust (\&gt;60 μm) just preceding the Holocene. Adjacent layers containing eolian particles \&gt;60 μm in a core from Carpentaria relate to (perhaps intermittent) periods of eolian activity involving sediment deflation, and thus aridity, in northern Australia, each spanning at least 600 yr; major peaks of dust deposition occurred about every 2.25 ka. Such amplitude of cyclicity has already been recognized elsewhere on the globe for other phenomena, including waxing and waning of North American and European mountain glaciers, oxygen-isotope records from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores, changes in deep-sea benthic foraminiferal composition, oxygen-isotope records of deep-sea foraminifera, and atmospheric 14C variations. We propose that the cold Younger Dryas event that affected the Northern Hemisphere is matched by a significant dry event in the tropical region of northern Australia and that the timing of this event fits well into the ∼2.25 ka cyclic pattern described here. Thus, the Younger Dryas is a phenomenon of global significance and is not an "odd" event, contrary to current belief. In addition, we propose that activation of dunes in northeastern Australia, over periods of ∼600 yr, corresponds to, perhaps intermittently, stronger easterly trade winds. During such periods the Intertropical Convergence Zone may not have extended as far south as it does today.},

  abstract = {Efforts to understand the influence of historical global warming on individual extreme climate events have increased over the past decade. However, despite substantial progress, events that are unprecedented in the local observational record remain a persistent challenge. Leveraging observations and a large climate model ensemble, we quantify uncertainty in the influence of global warming on the severity and probability of the historically hottest month, hottest day, driest year, and wettest 5-d period for different areas of the globe. We find that historical warming has increased the severity and probability of the hottest month and hottest day of the year at {$>$}80\% of the available observational area. Our framework also suggests that the historical climate forcing has increased the probability of the driest year and wettest 5-d period at 57\% and 41\% of the observed area, respectively, although we note important caveats. For the most protracted hot and dry events, the strongest and most widespread contributions of anthropogenic climate forcing occur in the tropics, including increases in probability of at least a factor of 4 for the hottest month and at least a factor of 2 for the driest year. We also demonstrate the ability of our framework to systematically evaluate the role of dynamic and thermodynamic factors such as atmospheric circulation patterns and atmospheric water vapor, and find extremely high statistical confidence that anthropogenic forcing increased the probability of record-low Arctic sea ice extent.},

  abstract = {Extreme droughts, heat waves, frosts, precipitation, wind storms and other climate extremes may impact the structure, composition and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, and thus carbon cycling and its feedbacks to the climate system. Yet, the interconnected avenues through which climate extremes drive ecological and physiological processes and alter the carbon balance are poorly understood. Here, we review the literature on carbon cycle relevant responses of ecosystems to extreme climatic events. Given that impacts of climate extremes are considered disturbances, we assume the respective general disturbance-induced mechanisms and processes to also operate in an extreme context. The paucity of well-defined studies currently renders a quantitative meta-analysis impossible, but permits us to develop a deductive framework for identifying the main mechanisms (and coupling thereof) through which climate extremes may act on the carbon cycle. We find that ecosystem responses can exceed the duration of the climate impacts via lagged effects on the carbon cycle. The expected regional impacts of future climate extremes will depend on changes in the probability and severity of their occurrence, on the compound effects and timing of different climate extremes, and on the vulnerability of each land-cover type modulated by management. Although processes and sensitivities differ among biomes, based on expert opinion, we expect forests to exhibit the largest net effect of extremes due to their large carbon pools and fluxes, potentially large indirect and lagged impacts, and long recovery time to regain previous stocks. At the global scale, we presume that droughts have the strongest and most widespread effects on terrestrial carbon cycling. Comparing impacts of climate extremes identified via remote sensing vs. ground-based observational case studies reveals that many regions in the (sub-)tropics are understudied. Hence, regional investigations are needed to allow a global upscaling of the impacts of climate extremes on global carbon–climate feedbacks.},

  abstract = {We present a precisely dated, multi-proxy stalagmite record from Liang Luar Cave, Flores (southeast Indonesia) that reveals a rapid increase in Indonesian monsoon rainfall at ∼9.5~ka. A “ramp-fitting” method for detecting statistically significant inflections in a time-series was applied to the stalagmite δ18O, Mg/Ca, and Sr/Ca profiles to quantify the precise timing and magnitude of an abrupt increase in monsoon strength over a period of ∼350~years. Previously published lake-level records from the monsoon-affected Australian interior show a sudden intensification of the Australian monsoon at ∼14~ka. However, our records indicate that monsoon intensification in Flores occured ∼4–5~kyr later. The timing of the monsoon shift in Flores is synchronous with the rapid expansion of rainforest in northeast Australia and regional freshening of the southern Makassar Strait which, under present-day conditions, is sensitive to monsoon variability. The freshening of southern Makassar was coeval with an abrupt ∼1.5~°C cooling in the upper thermocline of the Timor Sea ∼9.5~ka, indicative of reduced surface heat transport by the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) when the Java Sea opened during postglacial sea-level rise. This suggests that the abrupt increase in monsoon rainfall on Flores was not due to a change in the ITF – because a decrease in rainfall would be expected to accompany cooler local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) – but rather by the sudden increase in ocean surface area and/or temperature in the monsoon source region as the Sunda Shelf flooded during deglaciation. We propose that it was the abrupt intensification of the monsoon through the late deglaciation that maintained the subsequent structure of the ITF following the flooding of the Sunda Shelf at ∼9.5~ka.},

  abstract = {Birth of the Cool Over the past 4 million years or so, tropical sea surface temperatures have experienced a cooling trend (see the Perspective by Philander). Herbert et al. (p. 1530) analyzed sea surface temperature records of the past 3.5 million years from low-latitude sites spanning the world's major ocean basins in order to determine the timing and magnitude of the cooling that has accompanied the intensification of Northern Hemisphere ice ages since the Pliocene. Martínez-Garcia et al. (p. 1550) found that the enigmatic eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue, a feature one might not expect to find in such a warm region receiving so much sunlight, first appeared between 1.8 and 1.2 million years ago. Its appearance was probably in response to a general shrinking of the tropical warm water pool caused by general climate cooling driven by changes in Earth's orbit. Determining the timing and amplitude of tropical sea surface temperature (SST) change is an important part of solving the puzzle of the Plio-Pleistocene ice ages. Alkenone-based tropical SST records from the major ocean basins show coherent glacial-interglacial temperature changes of 1° to 3°C that align with (but slightly lead) global changes in ice volume and deep ocean temperature over the past 3.5 million years. Tropical temperatures became tightly coupled with benthic δ18O and orbital forcing after 2.7 million years. We interpret the similarity of tropical SST changes, in dynamically dissimilar regions, to reflect “top-down” forcing through the atmosphere. The inception of a strong carbon dioxide–greenhouse gas feedback and amplification of orbital forcing at \textasciitilde 2.7 million years ago connected the fate of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets with global ocean temperatures since that time. Tropical sea surface temperatures were controlled more by atmospheric connections to glaciation cycles than by ocean circulation.

  abstract = {This study summarizes the results of radiocarbon dating and age-depth modelling in four mountain lakes (Brazi, Gales, Bucura and Lia) in the Retezat Mountains. Altogether 69 AMS 14C measurements were performed on these deposits, mostly on terrestrial plant macrofossils. In several cases, plant macrofossils, aquatic animal remains (Cladoceran eggs) and bulk sediment were measured from the same depth allowing for the comparison of various sediment components in terms of their dating potential. Age-depth models were developed using both Bayesian modelling with the BACON and smooth spline curve fitting with the CLAM software. In this study Bayesian models are applied to identify outlier 14C dates, while smooth spline models are used to model sediment accumulation age-depth relations, as these are more likely to follow natural deposition time changes of lake sediments. Changes in sediment deposition times (DT) in relation to catchment size and climate are also studied. DT varied considerably in the late glacial (LG) part of the records. The sediment sequence characterised by high deposition rates during the late glacial (DT maximum around 100–110~years~cm−1) was defined by small catchment size (Lake Brazi, 6~ha; surface area: 0.5~ha). In contrast, much slower LG sediment deposition in the southern slope lake characterised by large catchment area (Lake Lia, 171~ha, 20~years~cm−1), principally reflecting strong erosion in these catchment areas at times when vegetation cover was scarce. Holocene was characterised again by variable DT values, but only Lake Gales showed extreme values: 62–110 years between 10,900 and 6050~cal~yr~BP, followed by much slower sediment deposition in the last 6000 years (av. 29~years~cm−1). Generally, sediment deposition times were largely dependent on the stability and vegetation cover of the slope in the case of high altitude deep lakes, while lower altitude, shallow lakes showed slower sediment deposition time in the early and mid-Holocene, when summer insolation was higher than today. This reflects that in these shallow lakes in-lake organic production probably increased with summer insolation, which was a significant driver in the rate of deposition.},

Here we integrate high-resolution riverine runoff and dust proxy data from X-ray fluorescence scanner measurements in four well-dated sediment cores, forming a NE–SW transect across the Timor Sea. Our records reveal that the development of the Australian monsoon closely followed the deglacial warming history of Antarctica. A minimum in riverine runoff documents dry conditions throughout the region during the Antarctic Cold Reversal (15–12.9\,ka). Massive intensification of the monsoon coincided with Southern Hemisphere warming and intensified greenhouse forcing over Australia during the atmospheric CO2 rise at 12.9–10\,ka. We relate the earlier onset of the monsoon in the Timor Strait (13.4\,ka) to regional changes in landmass exposure during deglacial sea-level rise. A return to dryer conditions occurred between 8.1 and 7.3\,ka following the early Holocene runoff maximum.},

  abstract = {Several areas of earth science require knowledge of the fluctuations in sea level and ice volume through glacial cycles. These include understanding past ice sheets and providing boundary conditions for paleoclimate models, calibrating marine-sediment isotopic records, and providing the background signal for evaluating anthropogenic contributions to sea level. From ∼1,000 observations of sea level, allowing for isostatic and tectonic contributions, we have quantified the rise and fall in global ocean and ice volumes for the past 35,000 years. Of particular note is that during the ∼6,000 y up to the start of the recent rise ∼100−150 y ago, there is no evidence for global oscillations in sea level on time scales exceeding ∼200 y duration or 15−20 cm amplitude.The major cause of sea-level change during ice ages is the exchange of water between ice and ocean and the planet’s dynamic response to the changing surface load. Inversion of ∼1,000 observations for the past 35,000 y from localities far from former ice margins has provided new constraints on the fluctuation of ice volume in this interval. Key results are: (i) a rapid final fall in global sea level of ∼40 m in \&lt;2,000 y at the onset of the glacial maximum ∼30,000 y before present (30 ka BP); (ii) a slow fall to −134 m from 29 to 21 ka BP with a maximum grounded ice volume of ∼52 × 106 km3 greater than today; (iii) after an initial short duration rapid rise and a short interval of near-constant sea level, the main phase of deglaciation occurred from ∼16.5 ka BP to ∼8.2 ka BP at an average rate of rise of 12 m⋅ka−1 punctuated by periods of greater, particularly at 14.5–14.0 ka BP at ≥40 mm⋅y−1 (MWP-1A), and lesser, from 12.5 to 11.5 ka BP (Younger Dryas), rates; (iv) no evidence for a global MWP-1B event at ∼11.3 ka BP; and (v) a progressive decrease in the rate of rise from 8.2 ka to ∼2.5 ka BP, after which ocean volumes remained nearly constant until the renewed sea-level rise at 100–150 y ago, with no evidence of oscillations exceeding ∼15–20 cm in time intervals ≥200 y from 6 to 0.15 ka BP.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis that the late Holocene climate of northern Australia has been characterised by periods of reduced rainfall has been examined by constructing a detailed chronostratigraphy of climatically sensitive geomorphological sites, in particular dunefields and lake deposits. There is clear evidence of aridity during the last glacial period (c. 18,000 BP), and disturbance of coastal deposits by rising sea level until 5500 BP. Following the flooding of the shallow Sunda and Sahul shelves, the climate of northern Australia appears to have become increasingly variable with an arid trend interrupted by periods of increased rainfall between 3500 and 2800 BP, again between 2100 and 1600 BP and possibly twice during the last 1000 years. It is proposed that the dry episodes are associated with persistent, large‐scale sinking, dry south‐easterly flows over the Australian tropics inhibiting the onset of the north Australian monsoon. These are similar to flows associated with present‐day ENSO events. The pattern suggests that ENSO may be associated with a larger process which may not have begun to operate until the flooding of the shallow Sunda and Sahul shelves and the opening of the Indonesian throughflow between the Pacific and Indian oceans.},

  abstract = {It has been known since Rhodes Fairbridge’s first attempt to establish a global pattern of Holocene sea-level change by combining evidence from Western Australia and from sites in the northern hemisphere that the details of sea-level history since the Last Glacial Maximum vary considerably across the globe. The Australian region is relatively stable tectonically and is situated in the ‘far-field’ of former ice sheets. It therefore preserves important records of post-glacial sea levels that are less complicated by neotectonics or glacio-isostatic adjustments. Accordingly, the relative sea-level record of this region is dominantly one of glacio-eustatic (ice equivalent) sea-level changes. The broader Australasian region has provided critical information on the nature of post-glacial sea level, including the termination of the Last Glacial Maximum when sea level was approximately 125m lower than present around 21,000–19,000 years BP, and insights into meltwater pulse 1A between 14,600 and 14,300cal.yrBP. Although most parts of the Australian continent reveals a high degree of tectonic stability, research conducted since the 1970s has shown that the timing and elevation of a Holocene highstand varies systematically around its margin. This is attributed primarily to variations in the timing of the response of the ocean basins and shallow continental shelves to the increased ocean volumes following ice-melt, including a process known as ocean siphoning (i.e. glacio-hydro-isostatic adjustment processes). Several seminal studies in the early 1980s produced important data sets from the Australasian region that have provided a solid foundation for more recent palaeo-sea-level research. This review revisits these key studies emphasising their continuing influence on Quaternary research and incorporates relatively recent investigations to interpret the nature of post-glacial sea-level change around Australia. These include a synthesis of research from the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia. A focus of these more recent studies has been the re-examination of: (1) the accuracy and reliability of different proxy sea-level indicators; (2) the rate and nature of post-glacial sea-level rise; (3) the evidence for timing, elevation, and duration of mid-Holocene highstands; and, (4) the notion of mid- to late Holocene sea-level oscillations, and their basis. Based on this synthesis of previous research, it is clear that estimates of past sea-surface elevation are a function of eustatic factors as well as morphodynamics of individual sites, the wide variety of proxy sea-level indicators used, their wide geographical range, and their indicative meaning. Some progress has been made in understanding the variability of the accuracy of proxy indicators in relation to their contemporary sea level, the inter-comparison of the variety of dating techniques used and the nuances of calibration of radiocarbon ages to sidereal years. These issues need to be thoroughly understood before proxy sea-level indicators can be incorporated into credible reconstructions of relative sea-level change at individual locations. Many of the issues, which challenged sea-level researchers in the latter part of the twentieth century, remain contentious today. Divergent opinions remain about: (1) exactly when sea level attained present levels following the most recent post-glacial marine transgression (PMT); (2) the elevation that sea-level reached during the Holocene sea-level highstand; (3) whether sea-level fell smoothly from a metre or more above its present level following the PMT; (4) whether sea level remained at these highstand levels for a considerable period before falling to its present position; or (5) whether it underwent a series of moderate oscillations during the Holocene highstand.},

This study extends U/Th dating by applying it not only to calcretes, but also to Fe/Mn oxyhydroxide/oxide accumulations. While a direct correlation cannot be made between U/Th dates from secondary minerals and TL dates from the host sediments, both sets of data show broad consistency. In addition to providing a minima for acceptable TL ages, U/Th dates are useful for determining the chronology of pedogenesis/diagenesis. They show that calcretes and ferricretes have formed under similar climatic conditions in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia during the late pleistocene. Beneath about 5–12 m the Gilbert fan delta consists of an extensive sand body older than 85,000 yr and probably about 120,000 yr in age, representative of a period of major fluvial activity not repeated since this time. Above are muds and fine sandy muds that extend uninterrupted to the present surface except in the downstream fan where they are bisected by a thin unit of medium sand that TL dates at 40,000–50,000 yr B.P. A system of sandy distributary channels over the fan surface represents an early Holocene fluvial phase probably more active than at present.},

  abstract = {Growing climate proxy evidence suggests that changes in sea level are important drivers of tropical climate change on glacial-interglacial timescales. These paleodata suggest that rainfall patterns over the Indo-Pacific warm pool (IPWP) are highly sensitive to the landmass configuration of the Maritime Continent and that lowered sea level contributed to large-scale drying during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, approximately 21,000 years B.P.). Using the Community Earth System Model Version 1.2 (CESM1), we investigate the mechanisms by which lowered sea level influenced the climate of the IPWP during the LGM. The CESM1 simulations show that, in agreement with previous hypotheses, changes in atmospheric circulation are initiated by the exposure of the Sunda and Sahul shelves. Ocean dynamical processes amplify the changes in atmospheric circulation by increasing the east-west sea surface temperature (SST) gradient along the equatorial Indian Ocean. The coupled mechanism driving this response is akin to the Bjerknes feedback and results in a large-scale climatic reorganization over the Indian Ocean with impacts extending from east Africa to the western tropical Pacific. Unlike exposure of the Sunda shelf, exposure of Sahul shelf and the associated changes in surface albedo play a key role because of the positive feedback. This mechanism could explain the pattern of dry (wet) eastern (western) Indian Ocean identified in climate proxies and LGM simulations. However, this response also requires a strengthened SST gradient along the equatorial Indian Ocean, a pattern that is not evident in marine paleoreconstructions. Strategies to resolve this issue are discussed.},

  abstract = {Pyrogenic carbon (charcoal, black carbon, elemental carbon) is one of the most common materials used for radiocarbon dating of terrestrial samples. However, exogenous carbon contamination can compromise the accuracy of radiocarbon ages. This study presents the results of two chemical pretreatments prior to hydrogen pyrolysis (hypy) as improved protocols for the isolation and decontamination of pyrogenic carbon, i) a simple acid-oxidation step (A-Ox/hypy) and ii) acid-base-acid (ABA/hypy). The A-Ox/hypy protocol uses HNO3 and H2O2, while ABA/hypy uses HCl and NaOH. Both pretreatments remove labile and inorganic carbon before hypy, decreasing the potential for in situ production of pyrogenic carbon during the hypy reaction. The effectiveness of each protocol was directly measured on charcoal artificially produced at 350 °C, 450 °C and 550 °C from radiocarbon-free wood, and exposed to environmental contamination for 1–3 yrs. The results show a {$>$}94\% reduction in carbon contamination for the 450 °C and 550 °C charcoal samples occurred using A-Ox/hypy, but this treatment was less effective for the 350 °C charcoal. A {$>$}99\% reduction in carbon contamination in all charcoal samples examined occurred using ABA/hypy. The A-Ox/hypy protocol was further tested on cave guano sediments, which had previously reported erroneous dates following simple organic solvent extraction followed by ABA pretreatment. Effective decontamination was achieved using A-Ox/hypy on the guano, which corrected a radiocarbon age reversal. Overall, ABA/hypy effectively decontaminated the charcoals and was a more efficient pretreatment for charcoal than A-Ox/hypy, however resulting in larger sample mass loss. Therefore, ABA/hypy is the recommended protocol for older ({$>$}30,000 14C yr BP) charcoal or sediment samples, or where date accuracy is imperative, while A-Ox/hypy represents an improved protocol for the quick and cost-effective measurement of younger samples ({$<$}30,000 14C yr BP) when sample size is of concern.},

Consequently, it is important to characterize the δ13C values of modern plants and surface soils to provide analogues for strengthening paleoclimatic reconstructions. In this paper, {$>$}10.000 previously reported δ13C values from modern plants and surface soils at globally distributed sites, together with newly obtained surface soil δ13C data from 107 sites in inland China, are used to establish relationships with corresponding mean annual temperature (MAT) and precipitation amount (MAP). Using a δ13C value of −24‰ of surface soil as the discriminator between pure C3 vegetation and C3/C4 mixed vegetation, our results demonstrate a close relationship between MAT and C4 relative abundance, implying that temperature is the primary climatic factor determining the C3/C4 relative abundance. Both the δ13C values of modern C3 plants and surface soils under pure C3 vegetation are significantly negatively correlated with MAP, confirming that the δ13C of material sourced from pure C3 vegetation can be used for paleoprecipitation reconstruction. However, unlike C3 plants, the δ13C values of modern C4 plants are significantly positively correlated with MAP. Thus our results can serve as a reference for the paleoclimatic interpretation of sedimentary δ13C data.},

  abstract = {Understanding the main factors driving fire regimes in grasslands and savannas is critical to better manage their biodiversity and functions. Moreover, improving our knowledge on pyrogenic carbon (PyC) dynamics, including formation, transport and deposition, is fundamental to better understand a significant slow-cycling component of the global carbon cycle, particularly as these ecosystems account for a substantial proportion of the area globally burnt. However, a thorough assessment of past fire regimes in grass-dominated ecosystems is problematic due to challenges in interpreting the charcoal record of sediments. It is therefore critical to adopt appropriate sampling and analytical methods to allow the acquisition of reliable data and information on savanna fire dynamics. This study uses hydrogen pyrolysis (HyPy) to quantify PyC abundance and stable isotope composition (δ13C) in recent sediments across 38 micro-catchments covering a wide range of mixed C3/C4 vegetation in north Queensland, Australia. We exploited the contrasting δ13C values of grasses (i.e. C4; δ13C {$>$}-15‰) and woody vegetation (i.e. C3; δ13C {$<$}-24‰) to assess the preferential production and transport of grass-derived PyC in savanna ecosystems. Analyses were conducted on bulk and size-fractionated samples to determine the fractions into which PyC preferentially accumulates. Our data show that the δ13C value of PyC in the sediments is decoupled from the δ13C value of total organic carbon, which suggests that a significant component of PyC may be derived from incomplete grass combustion, even when the proportion of C4 grass biomass in the catchment was relatively small. Furthermore, we conducted 16 experimental burns that indicate that there is a comminution of PyC produced in-situ to smaller particles, which facilitates the transport of this material, potentially affecting its preservation potential. Savanna fires preferentially burn the grass understory rather than large trees, leading to a bias toward the finer C4–derived PyC in the sedimentary record. This in turn, provides further evidence for the preferential production and transport of C4-derived PyC in mixed ecosystems where grass and woody vegetation coexist. Moreover, our isotopic approach provides independent validation of findings derived from conventional charcoal counting techniques concerning the appropriateness of adopting a relatively small particle size threshold.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Widespread burning of mixed tree–grass ecosystems represents the major natural locus of pyrogenic carbon (PyC) production. PyC is a significant, pervasive and yet poorly understood "slow-cycling" form of carbon present in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, soils and sediments. We conducted 16 experimental burns on a rainfall transect through northern Australian savannas with C\textsubscript{4} grasses ranging from 35 to 99\% of total biomass. Residues from each fire were partitioned into PyC and further into recalcitrant (HyPyC) components, with each of these fluxes also partitioned into proximal components ({$>$}125 μm), likely to remain close to the site of burning, and distal components (\&lt;125 μm), likely to be transported from the site of burning. The median (range) PyC production across all burns was 16.0 (11.5) \% of total carbon exposed (TCE), with HyPyC accounting for 2.5 (4.9) \% of TCE. Both PyC and HyPyC were dominantly partitioned into the proximal flux. Production of HyPyC was strongly related to fire residence time, with shorter duration fires resulting in higher HyPyC yields. The carbon isotope (δ\textsuperscript{13}C) compositions of PyC and HyPyC were generally lower by 1–3\&permil; relative to the original biomass, with marked depletion up to 7\&permil; for grasslands dominated by C\textsubscript{4} biomass. δ\textsuperscript{13}C values of CO\textsubscript{2} produced by combustion were computed by mass balance and ranged from \textasciitilde 0.4 to 1.3\&permil;. The depletion of \textsuperscript{13}C in PyC and HyPyC relative to the original biomass has significant implications for the interpretation of δ\textsuperscript{13}C values of savanna soil organic carbon and of ancient PyC preserved in the geologic record, as well as for global \textsuperscript{13}C isotopic disequilibria calculations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) and nitrogen isotope ratios, N-concentrations and specific leaf area of 50 tree species were investigated along a continental-scale transect through northern Australia over which annual rainfall varied from 1800 mm to 216 mm rainfall. Average specific leaf area (SLA, m2 kg-1) of leaves ranged from 10.7 ± 1.7 (av. ± s.d.) in N2 fixing deciduous trees to 0.8 ± 0.4 in spinescent sclerophylls shrubs. SLA generally decreased with increasing aridity. N2 fixing species had higher leaf N concentration (average N-concentration 20.1 ± 3.7 mgN g-1) than non- N2 fixing (10.8 ± 3.3) or spinescent species (7.05 ± 1.8). Community-averaged Δ was approximately constant at rainfalls above 475 mm (average Δ = 19.4 ± 1.2‰). Where rainfall was less than 475 mm, Δ decreased from 19‰  to 17‰ at 220 mm. Δ was positively correlated with SLA. Δ of deciduous N2 fixing species and spinescent species were 1‰ and 2.4‰  lower than in evergreen sclerophyllous species. Δ in the N2 fixing Allocasuarina was 1.2‰ lower than in non- N2 fixing sclerophyllous species. The δ15N-values indicated N2 fixation only at high rainfall. Burning of the field layer in a Eucalyptus forest had no effect on all measured tree parameters including δ15N, but δ15N increased under grazing conditions to {$>$}5‰. The constant value of community averaged Δ between 1800 and 450 mm may be the result of replacement of functional types and species. The decline in Δ in the more arid section may be a function of both low species diversity, and a highly aseasonal and unpredictable rainfall regime.},

  abstract = {Carbon isotope natural abundance (δ13C) has been previously used as a powerful tool in the study of water-using processes at the leaf, individual and within-community levels. We analysed 348 species from 12 plant communities along a 900 km-long rainfall gradient in southern Queensland. Although the range of δ13C values found in a given community was large, variability in the δ13C signature of plants within a community was relatively small given the large numbers of species sampled (mean n per site of 29) and the taxonomic diversity in each. The community-averaged δ13C signature ranged from -25.60 in a brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) dominated community in western Queensland to - 31.20 in subtropical rainforest in eastern Queensland. A strong relationship was found between the δ13C value averaged for each site and rainfall within the range 350-1700 mm per annum. Foliar δ13C was also related to the number of rain days per annum and moisture balance (rainfall - evaporation). The strength of these relationships varied only slightly according to the rainfall parameter used, with values for r2 of 0.78, 0.70, 0.70 and 0.74 for the relationship between δ13C and long-term rainfall average, 5-year rainfall average, number of rain days and moisture balance, respectively. Despite considerable taxonomic variability within a given plant community, the averaged δ13C signature for that community gives a strong indication of moisture availability.},

We propose here that low sea levels during the Pleistocene2,3 (Fig. 2) resulted in subaerial exposure of the Gulf of Carpentaria, thereby reducing the regional input of moisture and latent heat to the atmosphere and tropical cyclogenesis. As a result, the climate of the Carpentaria Basin may have been significantly drier than at present4,5. Even so, previous workers6,7 have reported the presence of lacustrine sediments in the Gulf that could have been deposited when the sea level dropped below the −53-m contour1. During 1982, the extent of Lake Carpentaria was defined by high-resolution seismic profiles and cores. The size and development of Lake Carpentaria and its dependence on the hydrological balance are discussed below.},

The thermoluminescence chronology of the climbing dune indicates aeolian activity for the Last Glacial Maximum (ca 22 ka) and the mid‐ to late Holocene (ca 6 ka to the present). Adjacent alluvium provides evidence for fluvial activity at ca 37 ka (Subpluvial Stage 3) and a return to fluvial activity in the early to mid‐Holocene (ca 12–5 ka).

A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a “climate-smart food system” that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.},

  abstract = {Mangrove forests in northern Australia typically occur as fringes along tidal estuaries and relatively sheltered coasts. Radiocarbon dating evidence from the South Alligator River, presented here, suggests that extensive mangrove swamps developed between 6,500 and 7,000 yr ago and flourished for about 1,000 yr. Pollen analysis of a stratigraphic core at a mid-plains site links the growth of these forests with the interaction of sea-level change and sedimentation. This was succeeded by the development of flood-plains with tidal river channels, a dramatic ecological change that has implications for all coastal and nearshore systems.},
