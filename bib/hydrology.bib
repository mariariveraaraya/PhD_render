  abstract = {There is a known bias in C/N, δ13C and δ15N values of organic matter (OM) due to pre-analysis acid treatment methods. We report here, for the first time, the results of a pre-analysis acid treatment method comparison of measured C/N, δ13C and δ15N values in bulk OM from a sedimentary sequence of samples to illustrate this bias. Here we show that acid treatment significantly reduces the accuracy (between method biases) and precision (within method bias) of C/N, δ13C and δ15N values of OM, suggesting a differential response of sample OM between methods and sample horizons, and in some cases inefficient removal of inorganic carbon. We show that different methods can significantly influence environmental interpretation in some of our sample horizons (i.e. interpretation of aquatic vs. terrestrial OM source; C3 vs. C4 vegetation). Specifically, there are unpredictable and non-linear differences between methods for C/N values in the range of ∼1–100; δ13C values in the range of 0.2–6.8‰ and; δ15N values in the range of 0.3–0.7‰. Importantly, these ranges are mostly much greater than the instrument precision (defined as the standard deviation of replicate analysis of standard reference materials; for this study, ±0.5 for C/N values, ±0.1‰ for δ13C values and; ±0.1‰ for δ15N). The accuracy and precision of measured C/N, δ13C and δ15N values of bulk OM is not just dependent upon environmental variability, but on acid pre-treatment, residual inorganic carbon and organic matter state and composition. Collectively, this makes the correlation between samples prepared in different ways, including those from down-core reconstructions, highly questionable.},

  abstract = {Palaeoshorelines that lie submerged on stable continental shelves are relict coastal depositional and erosional structures formed during periods of lower sea level. An analysis of the well-dated Late Quaternary (0–128 ka) sea-level record indicates that the most persistent (modal) lower sea levels were at 30 – 40m below present, which occurred between 97 and 116 ka and at approximately 85 ka and 10 ka. A secondary modal position was at 70–90m that occurred mostly during a period of fluctuating sea level between 30 and 60 ka, as well as at around 87 ka (70 – 80m only) and 12−15 ka. For the tectonically stable Australian continental shelf, we show that a range of shorelines formed at each of these sea level modal positions and their morphology and degree of preservation depends on composition (carbonate vs siliciclastic) and oceanographic setting (wave, tide and wind energy). These ancient coasts record a range of oceanographic and geological regimes that existed during relatively long periods of lower sea level and provide a guide to the general depth zones in which similar features likely occur on other shelves globally. Australian palaeoshorelines represent distinctive benthic habitats that strongly influence the distribution of biodiversity across the shelf. Accurate mapping of these features provides a robust geospatial framework for investigations of marine species distributions and environmental change monitoring. These data also enable the better targeting of relict coastal areas that potentially include sand resources and sites of human occupation during periods of lower sea level.},

  abstract = {High resolution X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is presented as a robust palaeoclimatic proxy, suitable for use on Late Pleistocene to Holocene sediments located in a volcanic crater on the Atherton Tableland in northeastern Queensland, Australia. The proxy allows identification of wet and dry shifts in a complex sedimentary sequence comprised of peat, gyttja, laminated organic rich muds and fine clastic silt-rich sediments. Significant correlation is found between the XRF record and other proxies including magnetic susceptibility, humification, grain size, macrocharcoal, δ13C and C/N and pollen. Sixteen wetter periods are identified in the 37ka sedimentary record for Bromfield Swamp. Three wetter periods commence in late Marine Isotope Stage 3, nine in the early glacial, one in the late de-glacial and four in Holocene. Nineteen drier periods are identified, four in late MIS 3, seven in the early glacial, one during the LGM, one in the late de-glacial period and six in the Holocene. The XRF record for Bromfield Swamp is specifically used to identify periods of abrupt climate change. Marked changes in effective precipitation are detected at 32,690, 30,080, 24,660, 21,870, 11,880, 10,020, 9170 and 5120cal.yrBP. The detection of these abrupt climate events may allow correlation with records from terrestrial sites across the Southern Hemisphere and potentially, the Northern Hemisphere.},

  abstract = {Sediment grain size is a conventional proxy of climatic changes. Larger sediment grain size is often interpreted to indicate dry climate during lower lake level while smaller sediment grain size implies wet climate during higher lake level. Through detailed study on sediment grain sizes in Lake Erhai and Lake Chenghai, this paper reveals the different indication significances of sediment grain sizes in different time scales, different resolution investigations. For long time-scale and low resolution (102a or 103a) studies, larger sediment grain size indicates lower lake level, smaller lake area and drier climate while smaller sediment grain size indicates higher lake level, larger lake area and wetter climate. For short time-scale and high resolution (a or 10a) studies, larger sediment grain size reflects more rainfall and wetter climate while smaller sediment grain size reflects less rainfall and drier climate. Environmental information revealed by lacustrine sediment records is often different in different time scales because of the variance of sedimentation resolution, sampling resolution and dating precision. Therefore, paleoclimate implications of environmental proxies in long time-scale and low resolution investigations could not be mechanically applied to short time-scale and high resolution studies. Only after synthetically analyzing the influence manner and extent of all factors on the sediment records in different time scales, can credible conclusions be obtained.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of the Last Glacial period Indo-Australian summer monsoon (IASM) have revealed links to both northern and southern hemisphere high latitude climate as well as to regional ocean conditions. Particular interest has been paid to the monsoon response to Heinrich events, with variability explained by meridional shifts in positioning of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), but this model has not been adequately tested. In addition, the shorter-lived Dansgaard/Oeschger (D/O) events have not been detected (beyond D/O-1, the Bølling/Allerød) in land-based records from the Indo-Pacific, despite their prominent expression in stalagmites from southern Asia, raising questions about the sensitivity of the IASM to these events. Here we present a Southern Hemisphere stalagmite oxygen isotopic time series from Ball Gown Cave (BGC), tropical northern Australia, located on the margins of the modern austral summer ITCZ, that spans 40–31 and 27–8~ka. Elevated IASM rainfall coincides with Heinrich stadials and the Younger Dryas, while decreased rainfall characterizes D/O interstadials, a response that is anti-phased with sites spanning the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and with Chinese records of the East Asian summer monsoon. The BGC time series thus reveals a precipitation dipole consistent with a southward (northward) migration of the ITCZ during periods of high northern latitude cooling (warming) as the primary driver of millennial-scale IASM variability during the Last Glacial period. Our record indicates a strengthening of the IASM after the Younger Dryas period, likely as a result of rising sea level and sea surface temperatures, breaking the link with the high latitudes.},

  abstract = {Global climate variability during the late Quaternary is commonly investigated within the framework of the ‘bipolar seesaw’ pattern of asynchronous temperature variations in the northern and southern polar latitudes. The terrestrial hydrological response to this pattern in south-eastern Australia is not fully understood, as continuous, high-resolution, well-dated proxy records for the hydrological cycle in the region are sparse. Here we present a well-dated, highly resolved record of moisture balance spanning 30000–10000 calendar years before present (30–10 ka BP), based on x-ray fluorescence and organic carbon isotope (δ13COM) measurements of a sedimentary sequence from Lake Surprise in south-eastern Australia. The data provide a locally coherent record of the hydrological cycle. Elevated Si (reflecting windblown quartz and clays), and relatively high δ13COM, indicate an extended period of relative aridity between 28 and 18.5 ka BP, interrupted by millennial-scale episodes of decreased Si and δ13COM, suggesting increased moisture balance. This was followed by a rapid deglacial shift to low Si and δ13COM at 18.5 ka BP, indicative of wetter conditions. We find that these changes are coeval with other records from south-eastern Australia and New Zealand, and use a Monte Carlo Empirical Orthogonal Function approach to extract a common trend from three high-resolution records. Our analyses suggest that drivers of the regional hydrological cycle have varied on multi-millennial time scales, in response to major shifts in global atmosphere-ocean dynamics during the last glacial-interglacial transition. Southern Ocean processes were the dominant control on hydroclimate during glacial times, via a strong influence of cold sea surface temperatures on moisture uptake and delivery onshore. Following the last deglaciation (around 18 ka BP), the southward migration of cold Southern Ocean fronts likely resulted in the establishment of conditions more like those of the present day. Millennial-scale variability in records from the region is dominated by a persistent ca. 2300-year periodicity, consistent with other records across the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes; however, this pervasive periodicity is not obviously linked to the ‘bipolar seesaw’ and the mechanism remains equivocal.},

  abstract = {At present, knowledge of late Quaternary variability of the Indonesian-Australian summer monsoon in the Australian tropics is limited. Organic spring deposits, which occur throughout the Kimberley region of northwest Australia, are valuable archives that contain records spanning the past ∼14,500 years. In this study we compare multiple proxies from three organic springs. Principal Components Analyses demonstrates similar patterns of change in the elemental and non-pollen palynomorph (NPP) datasets between the springs, implying regional drivers are responsible for changes in these proxies. By comparison, the pollen records differ between each of the springs, with the assemblage at each thought to be influenced by spring recharge and evolution rather than climate variability. In order to empirically and objectively assess the synchronicity of changes, we applied Monte Carlo empirical orthogonal function (MCEOF) analysis to one variable in each μXRF and NPP dataset (Si/Ti ratios and Pseudoschizaea accumulation rates, as these proxies are expected to reflect hydrological conditions in springs) to assess regional patterns of change in site moisture. This analysis revealed periods of increased monsoonal precipitation from ∼14,500–7500 cal. yr BP corresponding with deglacial sea level rise, high orbital tilt coupled with warmer sea surface temperatures, and with possible links to a southward migration of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during the Younger Dryas. Monsoonal precipitation was reduced from 7500 cal. yr BP coinciding with the culmination of deglacial sea level rise and a possible northward shift in the mean position of the ITCZ, in addition to between 2600 and 1000 cal. yr BP corresponding with increased moderate-to-strong ENSO events.},

  abstract = {Climate change is impacting global surface water resources, increasing the need for a deeper understanding of the interaction between climate and biological diversity. This is particularly the case in the Southern Hemisphere sub-tropics, where little information exists on the aquatic biota response to climate variations. Palaeolimnological techniques, in particular the use of diatoms, are well established and can significantly contribute to the understanding of climatic variability and the impacts that change in climate have on aquatic ecosystems. A sediment core from Lake McKenzie, Fraser Island (Australia), was used to investigate interactions between climate influences and aquatic ecosystems. This study utilises a combination of proxies including biological (diatom), geochemical and chronological techniques to investigate long-term aquatic changes within the perched-dune lake. A combination of 210Pb and AMS 14C dates showed that the retrieved sediment represented a history of ca. 37,000cal.yBP. The sedimentation rate in Lake McKenzie is very low, ranging on average from 0.11mm to 0.26mm per year. A sediment hiatus was observed between ca. 18,300 and 14,000cal.yBP suggesting a period of dry conditions at the site. The diatom record shows little variability over the period of record, with benthic, freshwater acidic tolerant species dominating. Relative abundance of planktonic species and geochemical results indicates a period of increased water depth and lake productivity in the early Holocene and a gradual decrease in effective precipitation throughout the Holocene. Results from this study not only support earlier work conducted on Fraser Island using pollen reconstructions but also demonstrate that diatom community diversity has been relatively consistent throughout the Holocene and late Pleistocene with only minor cyclical fluctuation evident. This record is consistent with the few other aquatic palaeoecological records from the Southern Hemisphere sub-tropics.},

  abstract = {During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), ice volume reached a relative maximum and global temperature was lower than today. Understanding continental ice volume change requires accurate reconstruction of relative sea level, but tectonic uplift and isostatic adjustment effects complicate many records. Using marine sediment cores from the Bonaparte Gulf in northwestern Australia, a so-called “far field” tectonically stable site, Yokoyama et~al. (2000) reported that the LGM terminated abruptly at 19~ka with a rapid sea-level rise (19~ka event). Their sea-level reconstruction determined the age of the LGM termination, but the timing of its inception remained less well constrained, partly because the number of radiocarbon analyses was insufficient to clarify LGM duration. Here we return to the Bonaparte Gulf and present a new relative sea level that better constrains LGM duration with high-resolution radiocarbon dating of a recently recovered marine sediment core (water depth: 120~m, length: 583~cm). Radiocarbon dating of 23 molluscs and 26 bulk organic-matter samples, together with total organic carbon, total nitrogen, and stable carbon isotopes, provide a record of paleoenvironmental variability in response to sea level change. Our results indicate that the LGM sea-level minimum occurred at 20.8~cal~ka~BP and the LGM duration was shorter than previously reported.},

  abstract = {Little is known about the possible teleconnections between abrupt climatic changes originating in the North Atlantic and precipitation dynamics in the Australian–Indonesian summer monsoon (AISM) domain. We examine the climatic impacts of Heinrich stadial 3 (HS3) and Greenland interstadials 4 and 3 (GIS4/3) on AISM-associated precipitation through a high-resolution analysis of stable isotope (δ18O, δ13C) and trace element (Mg/Ca, P/Ca) ratios in a stalagmite from Liang Luar cave, Flores, Indonesia. Sixteen high precision 230Th dates indicate that stalagmite LR07-E1 grew rapidly (\textasciitilde 0.3–1.0mm/yr) in two phases between \textasciitilde 31.5–30.1ka and \textasciitilde 27.8–25.6ka, separated by a \textasciitilde 2.3kyr unconformity. Temporally consistent abrupt responses occur in the Flores record during HS3 and GIS4, which are coherent with changes in stalagmite δ18O records from China and Brazil. The response of low-latitude precipitation to HS3 cooling and GIS4 warming, as demonstrated by the widely separated sites, comprises three distinct simplified phases: (1) a strong southward migration of the ITCZ during HS3 is associated with a decrease in rainfall at Liang Luar cave and in China, while wetter conditions are reconstructed from Brazil, (2) represents the peak of HS3 impacts and an extended hiatus begins in the Flores record and (3) where suggested dry conditions at Liang Luar throughout GIS4 form part of a coherent north–south anti-phasing in precipitation changes. The reconstructed changes are also broadly consistent with NASA GISS ModelE-R simulations of a Heinrich-like freshwater perturbation in the North Atlantic basin, which produces a southward shift in the ITCZ. The relationship between the palaeoclimate records indicates that atmospheric teleconnections rapidly propagate and synchronise climate change across the hemispheres during periods of abrupt climate change. Our findings augment recent proposals that large-scale atmospheric re-organisations during stadials and interstadials play a key role in driving changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration, air temperature and global climate change.},

  abstract = {Unarguably, one of the most significant paleoclimatological discoveries of the last two decades has been that of abrupt climate events (Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles and Heinrich events). Most evidence for these events has originated from the high-latitude Northern Hemisphere, with few records documenting the response of the low latitude Southern Hemisphere. Here we present new data from Lynch's Crater, a unique terrestrial record from NE-Australia that may show evidence for southward propagations of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during abrupt climate perturbations as a result of alteration of the low latitude air masses. Proxies for precipitation/wetness indicate enhanced rainfall in the region during Heinrich events (H events 1–3) and the 8.2ka Northern Hemisphere cold event. A fully coupled atmosphere/ocean climate model simulating a 1 Sv freshwater influx to the North Atlantic Ocean produces a scenario which agrees with the climate changes shown by the Lynch's Crater record. The model shows precipitation anomalies that include a southward migration of the ITCZ and a zonal shift in mid-latitude storm tracks over the Southern Hemisphere equatorial region. These data indicate large-scale shifts of the austral summer ITCZ position that is known to control monsoonal precipitation in NE Australia. This terrestrial record from Australia may demonstrate the involvement of the tropical western Pacific Ocean in ITCZ migrations during abrupt climate events of the last glacial period. Defining such past migrations offers insight into the importance and role of the equatorial region in global climate dynamics.},

  abstract = {Contemporary benthic diatom assemblages were examined from 52 riverine and palustrine wetlands on Cape York Peninsula, Australia, to determine their environmental sensitivities and develop inference models. Multivariate analyses identified strong relationships between nine environmental variables and the diatom assemblage composition, with the aim to select variables for developing models. Total alkalinity, bicarbonate concentration, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and latitude were most consistently and strongly correlated with diatom composition. The river basins sampled generally have an east–west orientation, so latitude potentially represents biogeographic differences between basins. Comparison of diatom assemblages between river basins showed significant differences, but substantial overlap in species. Diatom-based transfer functions were developed for each environmental variable and tested using the relationships between measured values and values predicted by the transfer functions. These were significant, and had low root mean square errors. An independent validation dataset for EC was analysed and applied to the EC transfer function. Results showed good predictions, giving confidence in its relevance beyond the training dataset. These understandings and models of the environmental effects on diatom assemblages allow for their application to future monitoring programs and reconstruction of past water quality conditions using fossilised diatoms in layered aquatic sediments of Cape York.},

  abstract = {To better understand the response of tropical wetlands to Holocene environmental changes, two lacustrine diatom records from Weipa, Cape York, have been investigated. The record from Big Willum (BW01) commenced approx. 7.9 calibrated thousand years before present (k cal a BP) and details stages of initial swamp development, a phase of ephemeral conditions between approximately 5.7 and 2.2 k~cal a BP and relative wetland stability after 2.2 k~cal a BP. Lithological and to a lesser extent diatom assemblage changes in BW01 appear to be linked to broad-scale changes in effective precipitation. The record from Little Willum (LW01) commenced around 0.9 k~cal a BP and documents initial phases of swamp development until approximately 0.8 k~cal a BP with subsequent relative wetland stability. The uppermost 10~cm of this record, approximately spanning the last 40 years, coincide with mining activity in the region. Only minor changes in the diatom assemblage are recorded for this period implying that the overall character of the swamp probably remained unchanged. Both sites offer new insights into wetland dynamics in Australia's dry tropics and demonstrate that changes in these lacustrine systems were probably driven by shifts in effective precipitation, in particular during the late Holocene.},

  abstract = {The tropics are the major source of heat and moisture for the Australasian region. Determining the tropics' response over time to changes in climate forcing mechanisms, such as summer insolation, and the effects of relative sea level on exposed continental shelves during the Last Glacial period, is an ongoing process of re-evaluation. We present a synthesis of climate proxy data from tropical Australasia spanning the last 30,000 years that incorporates deep sea core, coral, speleothem, pollen, charcoal and terrestrial sedimentary records. Today, seasonal variability is governed largely by the annual migration of the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ), influencing this region most strongly during the austral summer. However, the position of the ITCZ has varied through time. Towards the end of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3, conditions were far wetter throughout the region, becoming drier first in the south. Universally cooler land and sea-surface temperature (SST) were characteristic of the Last Glacial Maximum, with drier conditions than previously, although episodic wet periods are noted in the fluvial records of northern Australia. The deglacial period saw warming first in the Coral Sea and then the Indonesian seas, with a pause in this trend around the time of the Antarctic Cold Reversal (c. 14.5~ka), coincident with the flooding of the Sunda Shelf. Wetter conditions occurred first in Indonesia around 17~ka and northern Australia after 14~ka. The early Holocene saw a peak in marine SST to the northwest and northeast of Australia. Modern vegetation was first established on Indonesia, then progressively south and eastward to NE Australia. Flores and the Atherton Tablelands show a dry period around 11.6~ka, steadily becoming wetter through the early Holocene. The mid-late Holocene was punctuated by millennial-scale variability, associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation; this is evident in the marine, coral, speleothem and pollen records of the region.},

  abstract = {An environmental history is presented from Girraween Lagoon, Darwin region of the Northern Territory, Australia. Pollen and charcoal analysis of a 5-meter sediment core provides a record of vegetation change, fire history and climate spanning 12,700 cal BP to the present day. This study focusses on tree-grass vegetation dynamics, eucalypt to non-eucalypt plant interactions, and climate–fire–human relationships in an area where few long-term savanna records exist. The dataset suggests wetlands experienced alternating episodes of ephemeral waterlogging and seasonal inundation due to post-glacial monsoon variability up until permanent inundation from approximately 6000 cal BP. The surrounding catchment transformed from a terminal Pleistocene–early Holocene wooded-savanna to a later Holocene open forest. This increase in woody cover was a prominent site feature, primarily driven by climate–moisture availability. In turn, the extent of fire and fire impact, is a function of climate–vegetation feedbacks. Such interplay between fire history, climate change and vegetation pattern was also influenced by more intense human management of the area, in the last 4000 years of the record. It is proposed Girraween may have become a much-socialized and managed human landscape in this late Holocene phase. Results provide essential baseline data describing savanna dynamics linked to contemporary ecological observation, understanding and management goals, and serves as an important resource for the Quaternary sciences and archeology of northern Australia.},

Our classification scheme emphasizes the macroscopic structure and microscopic components of the sedimentary matrix (clastic, chemical and biological) and can be applied to a wide range of lacustrine settings. Such a classification scheme is necessary to i) facilitate communication and collaboration between the highly interdisciplinary community of scientists that study lacustrine archives, ii) create a structure for comparative lacustrine sedimentological studies, and iii) take greater advantage of the great potential information recorded by changing depositional environments. Such a development is needed in light of current and planned Global Lake Drilling efforts and to expedite the creation of on-line, searchable databases of global lacustrine archives.

Here we present one reconstruction of environmental change for the tropics. This reconstruction covers the past 50 ka using a suite of geochemical data from the high-resolution sequence of Lynch's Crater in northeast Queensland, Australia, a region highly sensitive to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) activity. The 23 major oxides and trace elements measured could be summarised by extracting three axes using principal components analysis (accounting for 72\% of the variability). The data indicate that the greatest variability in the geochemical data accounted for erosional activity within the catchment that was associated with past changes in the frequency of ENSO activity (though this was less sensitive during wetter periods, probably as a result of buffering by high vegetation cover). The remaining variability was largely explained by elements that form complexes with organic compounds (e.g., humic acids) and those that are important nutrients for specific vegetation types (and therefore a measure of vegetation distribution). For more detailed reconstructions, further work is required to disentangle the complex controls of elements within sedimentary sequences.},

ENSO variability has been suggested to be linked to millennial-scale oscillations in North Atlantic climate during that time2,3, but the proposals disagree on whether increased frequency of El Niño events, the warm phase of ENSO, was linked to North Atlantic warm or cold periods. Here we present a high-resolution record of surface moisture, based on the degree of peat humification and the ratio of sedges to grass, from northern Queensland, Australia, covering the past 45,000 yr. We observe millennial-scale dry periods, indicating periods of frequent El Niño events (summer precipitation declines in El Niño years in northeastern Australia). We find that these dry periods are correlated to the Dansgaard–Oeschger events—millennial-scale warm events in the North Atlantic climate record—although no direct atmospheric connection from the North Atlantic to our site can be invoked. Additionally, we find climatic cycles at a semiprecessional timescale (∼11,900 yr). We suggest that climate variations in the tropical Pacific Ocean on millennial as well as orbital timescales, which determined precipitation in northeastern Australia, also exerted an influence on North Atlantic climate through atmospheric and oceanic teleconnections.},

  abstract = {The present paper addresses driving mechanisms of global monsoon (GM) variability and outstanding issues in GM science. This is the second synthesis of the PAGES GM Working Group following the first synthesis “The Global Monsoon across Time Scales: coherent variability of regional monsoons” published in 2014 (Climate of the Past, 10, 2007–2052). Here we introduce the GM as a planetary scale circulation system and give a brief accounting of why it exhibits regional structure. The primary driver of the GM is solar insolation, and the specific features in the underlying surface, such as land-sea distribution, topography, and oceanic circulations, are mainly responsible for the differences among regional monsoon systems. We then analyze the monsoon formation mechanisms, together with the major processes that drive monsoon variations at various timescales, including external forcings and internal feedbacks. On long time scales, external forcings often induce variability on a global scale, whereas short-term variability in regional monsoon systems is usually caused by internal feedbacks within the climate system. Finally, a number of debatable issues are discussed, with an emphasis on time scales beyond the instrumental record. These include the dual nature of the monsoon as wind and rain, the meaning of oxygen isotope in hydrological cycle, in particular of speleothem δ18O, the role of ice-sheet in monsoon variations, etc. In general, the GM as a system comprises a hierarchy of regional and local monsoons with various degrees of similarity, though all show coherent variability driven by a common solar forcing. The goal of the GM concept, therefore, is by no means to replace or diminish research on the regional monsoons, but to help dissect the mechanisms and controlling factors of monsoon variability at various temporal-spatial scales.},

  abstract = {The tropics are the main source of the atmosphere's sensible and latent heat, and water vapour, and are therefore important for reconstructions of past climate1. But long, accurately dated records of southern tropical palaeoclimate, which would allow the establishment of climatic connections to distant regions, have not been available. Here we present a 210,000-year (210-kyr) record of wet periods in tropical northeastern Brazil—a region that is currently semi-arid. The record is obtained from speleothems and travertine deposits that are accurately dated using the U/Th method. We find wet periods that are synchronous with periods of weak East Asian summer monsoons2, cold periods in Greenland3, Heinrich events in the North Atlantic4 and periods of decreased river runoff to the Cariaco basin5. We infer that the wet periods may be explained with a southward displacement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. This widespread synchroneity of climate anomalies suggests a relatively rapid global reorganization of the ocean–atmosphere system. We conclude that the wet periods probably affected rainforest distribution, as plant fossils show that forest expansion occurred during these intermittent wet intervals, and opened a forest corridor6,7,8 between the Amazonian and Atlantic rainforests.},
