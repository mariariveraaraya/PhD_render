Time,Hydroclimate,Vegetation and fire
33.1 - 29.2,Infilling of the lagoon,"Low fire activity limited availability of biomass to burn, Mostly aquatic plants, with limited contributions of C3 (sedges) and C4 (grasses) species"
33.1 - 29.2,"Associated with wet event/ low sea levels, but not as low as during LGM/ shift of ITCZ","Low fire activity limited availability of biomass to burn, Mostly aquatic plants, with limited contributions of C3 (sedges) and C4 (grasses) species"
33.1 - 29.2,"Small, shallow lagoon","Low fire activity limited availability of biomass to burn, Mostly aquatic plants, with limited contributions of C3 (sedges) and C4 (grasses) species"
22-18.2,Dry conditions,"Increased contributions of terrestrial taxa (mixture of land and aquatic derived plants), including more sedges and grasses."
22-18.2,"Small, shallow lagoon","Low fire activity limited availability of biomass to burn, Mostly aquatic plants, with limited contributions of C3 (sedges) and C4 (grasses) species."
22-18.2,No evidence of a drier LGM compared to previous period,"Low fire activity limited availability of biomass to burn, Mostly aquatic plants, with limited contributions of C3 (sedges) and C4 (grasses) species."
18.2-12.8,"wetter conditions, larger lake(increase in area)","Low fire activity continues.  Mixture of land and aquatic plants, with dominance of sedges."
12.8-9.7,"Increased rainfall, wetter conditions","Low fire activity continues.  Mixture of land and aquatic plants, with dominance of sedges."
12.8-9.7,Increase in sea level and flooding of Sahul,"Low fire activity continues.  Mixture of land and aquatic plants, with dominance of sedges."
9.7-7,Higher precipitation,"Dominance of terrestrial plant input (C3, sedges and arboreal) and peaks in fire activity between 9.3 ka and 7.1 ka. More availability of biomass to burn (C3)"
9.7-7,Expansion and deepening of the lagoon/ sea level high stand,"Dominance of terrestrial plant input (C3, sedges and arboreal) and peaks in fire activity between 9.3 ka and 7.1 ka. More availability of biomass to burn (C3)"
7-4.9,Drier/ northward shitt of the ITCZ,"Dominance of terrestrial plant input (C3, sedges and arboreal) and peaks in fire activity between 9.3 ka and 7.1 ka. More availability of biomass to burn (C3)"
4.9 - Present,Present stabilization and deepening of the lagoon,"Return to a mixture of aquatic and land derived plants, mostly sedges (C4)"
