Time,Hydroclimate,Vegetation and fire
33.1 - 29.2,"Infilling of the lagoon, associated with wet event/ low sea levels, but not as low as during LGM/ shift of ITCZ","Low fire activity and limited availability of biomass to burn. Mostly aquatic plants, with limited contributions of C3 (sedges) and C4 (grasses) species"
29.2-18.2,"Small, shallow lagoon reflecting dry and cool conditions",Increased C3 vegetation and low fire activity. 
18.2-9.7,"Wetter conditions, larger lake","Low fire activity continues.  Mixture of land and aquatic plants, with dominance of sedges."
9.7-4.9,Expansion and deepening of the lagoon/sea level high stand and higher precipitation,"Dominance of terrestrial plant input (C3, sedges and arboreal) and peaks in fire activity between 9.3 ka and 7.1 ka. More availability of biomass to burn (C3)"
4.9 - Present,Present stabilization and deepening of the lagoon,"Return to a mixture of aquatic and land derived plants, mostly sedges (C4)"
