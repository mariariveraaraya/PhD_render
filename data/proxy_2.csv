Process,Type of proxy,Proxy,Advantages,Disadvantages
Lake level,Carbonate-based,Ostracods,"Widely used, reliable",Not always available
Lake level,Silica based,Diatoms,"Widely used, reliable",Not available in alkaline lakes
Lake level,Silica based,Sponge spicules,Present in a broad range of environmental settings,Relationship with palaeohydrological factors is not well understood
Lake level,Sedimentological,Seismic,Very informative,"Mostly useful in large, deep lakes"
Lake level,Sedimentological,Organic matter,"Easy to analyse, high availability",Sources of organic matter are well known
Lake level,Sedimentological,Cellulose,Direct and quantitative reconstructions of palaeowater isotopic composition ,Complex isolation
"Precipitation, seasonality changes and hydroclimate",Biological,Pollen,Palynology is well developed,Transfer functions are not always available
"Precipitation, seasonality changes and hydroclimate",Biological,Chrominoids,Well-developed technique,"Time consuming, changes of temperature are not expected in the tropics"
"Precipitation, seasonality changes and hydroclimate",Geochemistry,XRF,"Fast, easy to perform",Interpretation is complex
"Precipitation, seasonality changes and hydroclimate",Geochemistry,Peat humification ,Direct correlation with water cycles,"Limited to peats, most developed in temperate areas"
"Precipitation, seasonality changes and hydroclimate",Compound specific isotopic analyses,Hydrogen isotope composition of plant wax lipids,found in almost all sedimentary environments that receive some terrigenous input ,Many factors can influence the isotopic signature
