Time,Hydroclimate,Vegetation and fire
33.1 - 29.2,"Infilling of the lagoon, associated with wet event/ low sea levels, but not as low as during LGM/ shift of ITCZ","Low fire activity limited availability of biomass to burn, Mostly aquatic plants, with limited contributions of C3 (sedges) and C4 (grasses) species"
29.2-18.2,"Small, shallow lagoon reflecting dry and cool conditions",Similar to the previous period
22-18.2,"Dry conditions, with no evidence of extreme dry LGM conditions.  Small, shallow lagoon","Increased contributions of terrestrial taxa (mixture of land and aquatic derived plants), including more sedges and grasses. Low fire activity limited availability of biomass to burn, mostly aquatic plants, with limited contributions of C3 (sedges) and C4 (grasses) species."
18.2-12.8,"wetter conditions, larger lake(increase in area)","Low fire activity continues.  Mixture of land and aquatic plants, with dominance of sedges."
12.8-9.7,"Increase in sea level and flooding of Sahul, and increased rainfall with wetter conditions","Low fire activity continues.  Mixture of land and aquatic plants, with dominance of sedges."
9.7-7,Expansion and deepening of the lagoon/ sea level high stand and higher precipitation,"Dominance of terrestrial plant input (C3, sedges and arboreal) and peaks in fire activity between 9.3 ka and 7.1 ka. More availability of biomass to burn (C3)"
7-4.9,Drier/ northward shift of the ITCZ,"Dominance of terrestrial plant input (C3, sedges and arboreal) and peaks in fire activity between 9.3 ka and 7.1 ka. More availability of biomass to burn (C3)"
4.9 - Present,Present stabilization and deepening of the lagoon,"Return to a mixture of aquatic and land derived plants, mostly sedges (C4)"
