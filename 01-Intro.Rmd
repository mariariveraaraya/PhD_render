# Introduction and aims

## Introduction

The tropics are home to approximately half of the world’s population and occupy one third of its landmass. Alarmingly, a growing body of evidence shows that these areas will feel the heaviest effects of global warming and climate change [@wheelerClimateChangeImpacts2013; @frankEffectsClimateExtremes2015; @diffenbaughQuantifyingInfluenceGlobal2017]. Increasing the number of local climatic and vegetation change records from the tropics is required to inform climatic projections and modelling relevant to managing these future changes. These models can contribute to tackling the environmental and economic impact of climate extremes (such as floods, droughts and related changes in fire activity) in our societies. By lengthening the environmental and climatic data record to thousands of years beyond the historical instrumental record, the uncertainty in projections of future environmental change can be reduced. 

In particular, knowledge generated by studying long-term palaeoenvironmental records from northern Australia provides important contextual information about climate variability in the Australian sub-tropics, humid and monsoonal tropics. This information can be used, for instance, to improve environmental management strategies for Australian tropical savannas in the future, given their socio-economic importance for agriculture and pastoralism  [@stoecklKeyIndustriesAustralia2007].

Northern Australia is one of the world’s most crucial places to pursue long-term studies  regarding human-environment relationships, given that there is evidence of at least 65,000 years of human occupation  [@clarksonHumanOccupationNorthern2017]. Investigating this area of the world contributes to the understanding of the connections between environmental conditions and human societies.

To understand climate variability and sensitivity, knowledge of long-term changes on millennial timescales is necessary. Records derived from lake sediments have proven to be useful across a range of geographical areas in recognizing changes in climate, precipitation and anthropogenic activities [@lengPalaeoclimateInterpretationStable2004; @meyersLacustrineSedimentaryOrganic1999]. Lake sediments contain geochemical proxies from a range of sources including the lake body and lake catchment and thus can record environmental and hydrological changes controlled by climate variations and anthropogenic activities. Records derived from lake sediments have proven to be useful across a range of geographical areas in recognizing changes in land use, palaeoclimate, palaeoecology and palaeohydrology. Indeed, palaeolimnology, the use of lakes to derive information about the past environmental conditions, is now a well-established field of study that makes essential contributions to our understanding of past environmental conditions [@cohenPaleolimnologyHistoryEvolution2003; @catalanGlobalChangeRevealed2013].

This project focuses on understanding the environmental history and geochronology of the Sanamere Lagoon in northern Cape York, tropical northern Australia (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-CP)). Two main considerations guided the development of the project: 1) Geochronology: to provide the information upon which to base optimized dating protocols for tropical lake sediments and 2) Environmental change and palaeohydrology: to create a high-resolution record of environmental change (sedimentological, vegetation and fire) for a region located in the tropical savannas of northern Australia.

## Thesis aims

### Geochronology 

* Aim I. Develop a protocol for building robust chronologies in tropical lake sediments using radiocarbon dating

Precise and accurate radiocarbon ages up the radiocarbon dating limit of ~ 50,000 years ago (and the chronologies derived from dating) are critical for testing hypotheses of synchronous (or asynchronous) archaeological, environmental and climatic change and the interpretation of proxy records derived from lake sediment sequences. Although there have been many studies investigating methods for improving chronologies from lake sedimentary archives, most research attempting to identify the material most appropriate for dating has focused on temperate and arctic regions. A single exception deals with peat cores in the tropics, where pollen was found to be the most reliable dating fraction [@wustComparisonRadiocarbonAges2008]. The application of hydrogen pyrolysis (hypy) pretreatment to isolate stable polycyclic aromatic carbon ("Hypy fraction") for dating appears to offer a viable approach to constructing chronologies from tropical organic spring deposits [@fieldUntanglingGeochronologicalComplexity2018], where other materials have been demonstrated to be unreliable. In addition, no previous studies carried out in tropical lakes have tested a diversity of carbon fractions in the same sediment core, as the present study is proposing, to optimize a dating protocol to produce robust lacustrine chronologies.

Furthermore, previous studies have reported significant discrepancies between dates for different carbon fractions in lake sediments from the same depth. For example, in boreal and arctic regions, lake sediment, wood and charcoal were found to be older than other macrofossil types, usually by several hundred years [@oswaldEffectsSampleMass2005]. Discrepancies have been found also within different types of macrofossils, with some of them more prone to an apparent ‘reservoir effect’. This effect can result in anomalously old radiocarbon ages of the dated samples by introducing preaged carbon [@alvesWorldwideMarineRadiocarbon2018]. For example, wood and charcoal were found to be older than other plant remains in some ecosystems. A possible explanation is the slower decomposition and longer terrestrial residence time of these materials [@oswaldEffectsSampleMass2005]

Additionally, several studies have demonstrated that there are significant uncertainties associated with dating bulk sediment [@bjorckHighresolution14CDated1998; @wustComparisonRadiocarbonAges2008]. Although organic-rich sediments from lake deposits provide diverse materials to analyze for radiocarbon dating, there is considerable uncertainty regarding which organic fraction yields the most reliable radiocarbon ages and how these ‘ages’ relate to the actual time of deposition of the material. In addition, the relatively hot and moist conditions that characterize much of the tropics influence the preservation of materials that could be analyzed in these settings. For instance, aberrant radiocarbon results could be linked with poorly preserved or degraded charcoal, for example when the combustion yields are lower than usually expected (50-60 % C by weight) [@highamRadiocarbonDatingCharcoal2009]. Also, the materials used for radiocarbon dating are prone to contamination and reservoir effects, which are known to cause serious deviations in the obtained ages, relative to age of deposition. Therefore, as well as providing a robust chronology against which to interpret the record of environmental change at Sanamere Lagoon, the creation of more effective and efficient pretreatment procedures for radiocarbon analyses is relevant to improving laboratory efficiencies, in turn lowering costs and increasing throughput.

The Sanamere Lagoon sequence offers a ‘best case’, ‘tropical’ opportunity to a) investigate the consistency of the age models derived from the different carbon fractions that were radiocarbon dated, b) study the causes of potential inconsistences in the radiocarbon dates and correlate the dates with potential disturbances/events along the length of the core.

Research questions: 

* How do the radiocarbon dates derived from diverse carbon fractions relate to each other within individual samples, and over time in multiple samples along the core?

* How and why do reservoir and contamination effects manifest themselves in the radiocarbon measurements of different organic fractions?

* How consistent are differences observed between the dated carbon fractions?

* How might differences between the ‘true’ and ‘observed ages’ be minimized by selection and dating of a particular ‘ideal’ fraction? 


### Environmental change and palaeohydrology

* Aim II. Reconstruct past climatic variability in northern Cape York Peninsula using the Sanamere Lagoon sediment sequence

* Aim III. Reconstruct past vegetation and fire activity in northern Cape York Peninsula using the Sanamere Lagoon sediment sequence

Although Australia has been the target of large projects (OZ-INTIMATE, Australian INTIMATE) aiming to develop a climate event stratigraphy for the region [@reevesPalaeoenvironmentalChangeTropical2013], there are very few records of past terrestrial environmental change of any time depth for the Australian tropics outside the Atherton Tablelands in the wet tropics (refer to chapter 2 for more details about past environmental records). Most (inland) pollen and charcoal records have focused on wetter parts of the region that contain extensive, permanent lakes and swamps or are from the marine realm, in association with marine environmental proxies. Continuous records of environmental change are scarce in the tropical savannas beyond the Holocene, given the poor preservation of proxy material due to the ephemeral nature of most lakes as a result of seasonality in rainfall. A few studies in the Pilbara region of northwestern Australia, the Northern Territory and northern Cape York have yielded some insights into the hydroclimate of the region. Most research has focused in building Holocene pollen records in Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria [@shulmeisterHolocenePollenRecord1992; @shulmeisterMorphologyChronostratigraphyCoastal1992; @shulmeisterAustralasianEvidenceMidholocene1999], Vanderlin Island [@prebbleHolocenePollenDiatom2005], Mornington Island [@mossEnvironmentalContextLate2015], Bentinck Island [@mackenzieGeochemicalInvestigationSouth2017], and northern Cape York [@rowePalynologicalInvestigationHolocene2007; @roweLateHoloceneSwamp2015]. However, the only studies focusing in palaeohydrology in tropical Australia have been pursued in Lake Carpentaria [@jonesLateQuaternaryEvolution1988; @mccullochStrontiumIsotopeVariations1989a; @reevesPalaeoenvironmentalChangeGulf2007; @reevesSedimentaryRecordPalaeoenvironments2008; @torgersenLateQuaternaryHydrological1985a; @devriendtLateQuaternaryEnvironment2011]. Other studies have reconstructed the terrestrial palaeoclimate records, which have been interpreted as providing indirect evidence of palaeohydrological conditions. More recently, palaeoecological records have also emerged from the Kimberley region in Western Australia [@fieldLateQuaternaryRecord2017; @dennistonStalagmiteRecordHolocene2013] (see section \@ref(pastclimate)).

During the last 33 ka, important environmental changes have influenced northern Australia (e.g. end of the last glacial period, reactivation of the monsoon, sea level changes, and the onset/intensification of El Niño-Southern Oscillation). These changes impacted and altered the vegetation composition and fire regime across the region. However, most terrestrial studies on this region have provided only Holocene records, covering ~ 12 ka or less (chapter 2). Marine records are longer compared to terrestrial records, and have provided information about climate and vegetation in the tropics of Australia over the last 30 ka. However, these records are low in resolution, and they do not necessarily represent terrestrial conditions on the Australian continent. For instance, the significant changes in sea-level and coastline proximity over this time frame suggest that we have limited knowledge of the multiplicity of factors that may have influenced the climate conditions over thousands of years. Moreover, marine records are primarily based on pollen (which could be sourced from different regions), and this variety of possible sources indicates these records may not represent local conditions. More terrestrial records, covering past glacial and interglacial periods contribute to track and better understand the dynamics between climate, vegetation, fire, and the local expressions of the environmental changes that occurred in the region.

While data for northern Australia is becoming more spatially and temporary refined, debates still remain on the climatic and vegetation responses that took place during the Last Glacial (31 ka - 22 ka) and Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (22 ka - 18 ka) periods in the Australian tropical savannas. For instance, regional syntheses indicate that drier, cooler conditions and low levels of carbon dioxide during the Glacial and LGM periods limited vegetation growth under these climatic conditions (mainly shrubs and herbs), but recent studies suggest that the local climatic responses were highly variable [@tierneyMolecularPerspectiveLate2010]. For instance, several wet episodes were initially proposed to have taken place during the Glacial in northern Australia [@nottPlungePoolsPaleoprecipitation1994; @nott30000Year1996], but recently the dates were declared uncertain [@mayRefiningLateQuaternary2015]. The available information for the Glacial and LGM periods in the northern Australian savannas is particularly limited, with interpretation further hindered by the low resolution and chronological uncertainties in the records [@marlonGlobalBiomassBurning2013], along with the observation that there are as yet no studies of vegetation and fire patterns for these periods. However, most studies agree that after the LGM, biomass increased and vegetation became more diverse in composition as precipitation, temperature and CO~2~ increased [@clarkGlobalClimateEvolution2012]. During the early Holocene, evidence from different sites suggests an increase in the frequency of fires starting at around 11 ka [@fieldCoherentPatternsEnvironmental2018] and the establishment of modern vegetation during the middle Holocene [@reevesPalaeoenvironmentalChangeTropical2013; @haberle23000yrPollen2005; @fieldCoherentPatternsEnvironmental2018; @stevensonLateQuaternaryRecord2001]. 

Fire has been recognised as a powerful ecological force, and the need to study fire across temporal scales has been highlighted recently [@mclauchlanFireFundamentalEcological2020]. The Australian tropical savannas are the most fire‐prone regions in Australia [@bowmanBiogeographyAustralianMonsoon2010; @russell-smithAustralianSavannaFire2007; @russell-smithSeasonalityFireSeverity2006]. Previous studies in these ecosystems have determined rainfall seasonality, biomass growth and human interventions to be the modern drivers of fire regime [@gillFireRegimesWorld2000; @russell-smithLANDSATMSSDerivedFire1997]. Conversely, fire influences the climate system by releasing carbon [@bowmanFireEarthSystem2009]. Records of the long-term fire and vegetation dynamics of savanna ecosystems constitute an important resource from which to understand modern patterns of ecological change, and thereby improve vegetation and fire management practices in the region, along with providing information to aid the validation of vegetation change models [@powerChangesFireRegimes2008]. However, little is known about the dynamics of vegetation and fire Australian tropical savannas in the past [@reevesPalaeoenvironmentalChangeTropical2013].

Fire records older than ~12 ka are scarce in the seasonal tropics of Australia. As such, generalizations of the past biomass burning patterns in the region are based on records derived from the wet tropics (Atherton Tablelands, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia) [@haberleBiomassBurningIndonesia2001;@mooneyLateQuaternaryFire2011]. These studies suggest that fire was infrequent over the Glacial and pre-glacial periods, with sites in the humid tropics (where information is available) showing peaks in biomass burning around 15 ka, probably a result of an increase in available woody fuel and increases in temperature and precipitation around this time [@haberleBiomassBurningIndonesia2001;@mooneyLateQuaternaryFire2011]. In northern Australia, the records from Big Willium (7.2 ka) [@stevensonPalaeoenvironmentalHistoryBig2015] and Girraween (9.7 ka and 7.7 ka) [@roweHoloceneSavannaDynamics2019] suggest increased burning during the middle Holocene. Variable patterns have been described for during the Late Holocene, based on records from the Kimberley, northern Australia and the wet tropics [@rowePalynologicalInvestigationHolocene2007; @roweLateHoloceneSwamp2015; @fieldCoherentPatternsEnvironmental2018; @haberle23000yrPollen2005]. Some studies have argued that this pattern in the later Holocene reflects an increase in climate variability associated with more active ENSO cyclicity [@mooneyLateQuaternaryFire2011; @kershawCompletePollenRecord2007].

There is a pressing need to extend our knowledge of the environmental dynamics into the seasonally dry parts of Australasia, particularly the Australian savannas that cover much of the Australian tropics (Figure \@ref(fig:savanna)). More research on the savannas is required to understand their response to climate change and variability in the magnitude of local to regional responses to climate forcing. These differences cause local signals to mask regional or continental scale responses to climate. For example, while in northern Cape York total annual rainfall has increased since 1950, regions along the southern Gulf of Carpentaria have become drier [@bomMonthlyClimateStatistics2018].

Research questions:

* Does the Sanamere sequence document periods of increased/decreased water availability in the past?

* Is there palaeolimnological evidence to suggest past hydrological changes?

* How do the results of this research relate to the palaeoclimate changes recorded elsewhere for northern Australia (e.g. wetter mid-Holocene (after 9 ka) [@lulyHolocenePalaeoenvironmentsChange2006], aridity in early Holocene [@nottEarlyHoloceneAridityTropical1999]?

* Does the Sanamere sequence document periods of changed fire and vegetation? And if so, how do these changes relate to hydrological change?

In addition, chapter 2 presents a literature review of the current knowledge of past climate, vegetation and fire on Cape York Peninsula in Australia. In the third chapter, the sedimentology and stratigraphy of the Sanamere sediment core is described, and this forms the foundation for the subsequent chapters. The fourth chapter addresses Aim I and contains the results of a comparison of several carbon fractions and pretreatments to determine the most reliable chronology for Sanamere Lagoon. Chapter 5 analyses the changes in climate and hydrologic conditions inferred from the lagoon sediment proxy records, while chapter six describes the vegetation and fire history of the area. Chapter 7 discusses the implications of the findings from chapters three to six and provides suggestions for future work (Figure \@ref(fig:flow1)). Each chapter includes a chapter summary at the end to facilitate the reading.

## Chapter 1 summary

Three basic aims are essential to understanding the environmental history of northern savannas of Cape York Peninsula: (1) Build a reliable chronology based on radiocarbon dating (2) Reconstruct the changes in palaeohydrology, and (3) Reconstruct the changes in vegetation and fire reflected at the site. 

These aims elaborate upon two major themes: the standardisation of protocols to build radiocarbon dating chronologies and the understanding of past environmental changes. The research addresses these themes by analysing a lake sediment core from Sanamere Lagoon in Cape York Peninsula. Next, chapter 2 contextualizes the research question through a description of the study site and a review of the literature on past environmental change of Cape York, and the methodological perspectives that inform this research.
