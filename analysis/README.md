# Analyses

This folder contains the analyses. Each experiment corresponds to 
one  `.Rmd or .R` file. Analysis files are named in the
standard way. If there is an experiment called "urntask", for instance, the 
corresponding analysis script should be called `analysis_urntask.Rmd`.

The analysis file should read data files from the [data](./data) folder, but 
should never write anything to that folder.
